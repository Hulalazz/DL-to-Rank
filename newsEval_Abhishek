<title>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN updated 8:56 PM EST, Wed January 22, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS This week is the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision The abortion issue is just as contentious as it was in 1973 The Pope tweeted his sentiments as thousands of pro-life marchers rallied in Washington Abortion remains a hot-button political issue at the federal and state levels Washington CNN -- The abortion issue is far from settled. It's just as contentious today as it has ever been in the United States. Wednesday's 41st anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which upheld legalized abortion before about 24 weeks, ignited the polarized, emotional battle. What's happening In sum, the Pope tweeted, thousands gathered, politicians pontificated. Anti-abortion activists have a bigger megaphone as it has come to remember the day they say the unborn lost their rights. Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall in the annual "March for Life" rally that drew buses of activists. This year they braved the snow that fell Tuesday and below freezing temperatures that followed. Pope Francis showed his solidarity , tweeting "I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable." Politicians sent releases, including Sen. Ted Cruz. "Every human life is a precious gift from God, and our law should protect innocent human life," the Texas Republican said. What's changed Thousands converge for March on Life GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape GOP tackles the abortion war In the abortion debate, each side tries to out maneuver the other. But the game is becoming more intense, complicated and consuming. Opinion: Why progressives should be pro-life Both sides are working at the local, state and federal level to pass laws. Obviously the anti-choice advocates want laws that restrict access to abortion while pro-choice proponents are working for measures that increase access to abortion care and options. Both sides are focusing on the court system, too, working to place judges that have a tremendous amount of clout in shutting down or allowing abortion-related laws. Who's winning The answer is not so cut and dry, but last year was a big year for anti-choice advocates. Even the president of one of the largest women's rights groups admitted that the anti-choice side made some inroads. "Things are in a crisis," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said. "The number of bills that have moved in the state legislature are definitely concerning." According to the group, 24 states adopted 53 anti-choice measures in 2013, including one in North Dakota that outlaws abortion as early as six weeks of gestation. Effectively outlawing abortion as many women don't know they are pregnant at six weeks. On the flip side, 10 states have adopted only 16 pro-choice measures, mostly involving access to care and contraception. What's Congress doing about it Not much. But efforts are in motion. After Republicans gained the majority in the House in 2010, they have been working to roll back access to abortion. Republican lawmakers launched a comprehensive attack on Planned Parenthood, women's health clinics that provide abortion services, working to cut their federal funding. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, caused major debates over abortion as opponents said it allows federal funding to be used for abortion services or providers who offer them. Supporters disagree as Democrats agreed to tighten language. The House passed the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act" that restricts abortions at 20 weeks, citing evidence that fetus feel pain at that time. But the measure is stalled in the Senate and President Barack Obama has vowed to veto it should it reach his desk. Does politics have anything to do with it Free Speech vs. Abortion Rights Dissecting the pope's in-depth interview Everything. While it won't make a campaign, it can surely break it. The Republican National Committee, which is holding its annual conference this week, put its events on hold and encouraged members to attend the "March for Life" rally. Abortion is a key topic of this year's meeting as a coalition of RNC members are introducing a resolution that encourages Republican candidates to "support Republican pro-life candidates who fight back against Democratic deceptive 'war on women' rhetoric by pointing out the extreme positions on abortion held by Democratic opponents." First on CNN: GOP urges candidates to stand ground on abortion It spurred Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' campaign. The issue launched her to political notoriety after she mounted a filibuster in the Texas legislature opposing restrictive abortion measures. But since she launched her candidacy, she's had to talk about a lot more than the abortion. Democrats are willing to highlight the issue when it frames Republican positions on abortion as extreme. "Last year, the GOP said they needed to reach out to women, but instead they've decided their plan is to spend more time fighting to restrict the rights of women to make their own health care choices," Democratic National Committee chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Rarely do candidates run on the issue and win. But the issue can doom candidates who make controversial remarks. In 2012, Missouri Senate hopeful Todd Akin's campaign took a nose dive after the Republican, who opposes abortion in all circumstances, made incendiary remarks. Democrats have worked to optimize Republican stances on abortion. They say the Republicans have launched a "war on women" and pounded the issue in campaign ads and stump speeches. Do people care Yes and no. While it's a topic that evokes strong opinions, it's unlikely that people will pick a candidate solely on the issue. According to a May CNN poll, 25% of people thought abortion should be legal in all circumstances compared to 20% thought it should be legal in no situation. A Gallup Poll released last week found that respondents thought abortion was one of the least important issues that the government address. It came in 17 out of 19 topics. What's next The Supreme Court is hearing three cases involving the issue, including McCullen v. Coakley, which challenges the buffer zone law in Massachusetts that creates a safe space around reproductive health care facilities. And there's also the Hobby Lobby case , which will be heard this spring. The chain store has asked the court to exempt it from providing contraception and "abortion-inducing drug" health coverage to their workers, which is required under the Affordable Care Act. And lawmakers will continue the battle around the country.</text>

<title>Abortion law ruling a win for women (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion law ruling a win for women By John C. Jennings updated 8:36 PM EDT, Mon August 4, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS John Jennings: Court strikes down Alabama law that erects barriers for abortion doctors He says law purported to protect women, but instead bars them from medical care Hospital privileges requirement an anti-abortion ruse. Abortion a very safe procedure, he says Jennings: Legislators who truly care about women's safety will work to prevent these laws Editor's note: John C. Jennings is president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- On Monday, a federal court struck down Alabama's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital. The court called the justification for the law "exceedingly weak." As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine. John C. Jennings Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws a number of states have adopted them do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety. That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them. Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications. For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare. View my Flipboard Magazine. Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis. It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period. In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations. Mississippi puts 'personhood' on ballot Court strikes down abortion buffer zones Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals. As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin. These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible. Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.</text>

<title>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban By Ann Furedi, abortion charity CEO, Special to CNN updated 8:31 AM EST, Tue February 18, 2014 Women protest in Madrid against the proposed changes to Spain's abortion law . STORY HIGHLIGHTS Spain's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape victims or women who would suffer lasting harm It would effectively reverse a 2010 law allowing abortion on request for the first 14 weeks Ann Furedi says Spanish woman would have to travel to other countries for terminations Furedi says women should be able to make a decision in line with their own moral values Editor's note: Ann Furedi is the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service -- a registered charity and the largest single abortion provider in the UK. It also offers other services such as pregnancy testing, counseling and STI screening. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. For a contrasting view point, click here. CNN -- Spain's controversial, and highly restrictive, new abortion law is now before Parliament, with approval looming . If passed this would mean that abortions will be permitted in only two circumstances: rape, and risk of "lasting harm" to the mother's health. The move would effectively reverse the abortion law of 2010, which permitted abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and up to 22 weeks where there was serious risk of fetal anomaly. Contrasting view: 'No unborn child is unworthy of legal protection' Ann Furedi The widespread opposition, both within Spain and elsewhere in Europe, indicates that the Popular Party's interest in the abortion law is not underwritten by a wider public and political desire to restrict abortion access. Throughout most countries in the developed world, with notable exceptions such as the Republic of Ireland, women's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services, which are often publicly funded. But the Spanish situation provides a shocking reminder of how quickly things can change in a country -- and the extreme consequences this can have for women. Back in 2004, a British newspaper wrongly accused British Pregnancy Advisory Service BPAS of referring women to Spain, when they were "too late" to have an abortion in Britain. The reality was that doctors in Spain were, at that time, legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24-week "time limit" permitted by British law. In the extremely rare cases where women were desperate to access abortion late in pregnancy, they would sometimes find that only a Spanish clinic was able to help them. Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape Texas abortion restrictions overturned Ireland abortion bill vote The Spanish law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations, but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy. Yet barely five years on, Spanish women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation. Will this mean that their need for abortion goes away Of course not. What it means is that Spanish women, like Irish women, will be forced to travel for care to Britain and other European countries. The Irish experience shows with heartbreaking clarity that when a nation makes abortion illegal, it does not prevent women's need for abortion, or their determination to access safe procedures. Outlawing abortion simply sends the issue overseas , increasing the financial and emotional cost to women and, of course, the gestation at which they are able to access a termination. Politicians in the 21st century must accept that abortion is a necessary back-up to contraception, and that it should be a woman's private and personal decision that she is able to make according to what she thinks is best for her and her family. It is a travesty that abortion is included in the criminal statute in so many countries -- including Britain. As a moral matter it should be for a woman to decide in line with her values; she should be allowed to take responsibility for life and choose what she thinks is best. As a medical matter, if should be regulated like any other medical procedure. This point was put very nicely by the London Times in December 2013, in a leading article challenging the new Spanish law. "To bring the criminal law into an issue of women's health and conscientious reflection is an abuse of government power," argued this establishment newspaper . "A constitutional society does not intrude into areas of personal judgment that most citizens consider fall within the authority of the family. Social engineering is the practice of autocratic governments." Spain is heading towards a self-made mess. We know from the situation in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, what the consequences of its new law are likely to be. The lesson for other governments is that they should stay out of women's personal decisions. "Nosotras Decidimos," proclaim the Spanish women's organizations protesting against their inhumane new law -- "We Decide." Throughout Europe, organizations such as BPAS will be standing behind them, and providing the services that these women need. But how much better it would be if they could access this care at home - as, until so recently, they could. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ann Furedi.

<title>Opinion: Why abortions are way down - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why abortions are way down By Timothy Stanley updated 9:54 AM EST, Tue February 4, 2014 Young anti-abortion demonstrators at the annual March of Life on the National Mall last month STORY HIGHLIGHTS Timothy Stanley: New study shows abortion rate at lowest point since 1973 He says politics of issue remain at high point. Reason is mass culture, politics drifting apart Many reasons for abortion drop. Better contraception, shifting views among young people Stanley: Politicians against abortion must face complexities of issue to be relevant Editor's note: Timothy Stanley is a historian at Oxford University and blogs for Britain's The Daily Telegraph. He is the author of "The Crusader: The Life and Times of Pat Buchanan." CNN -- The U.S. abortion rate is at its lowest point since 1973. In 2011, there were fewer than 17 terminations for every 1,000 women ; a fall of 13% since 2008 and only a little higher than when the Supreme Court handed down Roe v. Wade. You might not guess that's the way things are trending from what politicians have to say about the issue, given that they tend to prefer to discuss morals or rights rather than practicalities and realities. These numbers confirm that politics and mass culture are drifting further and further apart. What's caused the fall in abortions Some might be tempted to assume it's the various Republican-led state measures to restrict access to abortion; these include compelling abortion clinics to maintain the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers, which is for many clinics almost impossible to achieve. But most of those state efforts only started recently, so they can't explain a long-term trend against abortion since a peak of 29 terminations per 1,000 women in 1980 . Timothy Stanley According to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, which released the new study , the latest decline is largely the result of improved birth control. In tough economic times, they argue, people tend to pay greater attention to contraception because they are more aware of the potential material costs of becoming pregnant. Also, the arrival of new kinds of contraceptives on the market, such as long-term intrauterine devices, means people aren't relying on pills and condoms that can fail. Abortion rates lowest in 40 years But, surely, equally important is a quiet revolution in popular attitudes toward abortion. According to Gallup, in 1996 some 56% of Americans self-identified as pro-choice and 33% as pro-life. By 2013, only 45% called themselves pro-choice while 48% said pro-life. Part of the reason may be greater awareness of what a termination involves. Improvements in technology have made it easier to visualize and comprehend the fetus early on in development. The debate over late-term abortion has encouraged some to think of that fetus' potential. Ironically, Hollywood, which is expressly liberal, may have helped. Anti-abortion activists have talked about a "Juno effect," crediting the movie Juno, which is about a pregnant teenager who chooses to keep the child, with persuading many girls to see adoption or motherhood as better options than termination. Likewise, the Twilight series bear with me here promotes chastity, a borderline terror of male sexuality if a vampire bites you, he just can't stop and its lead character chooses to keep her baby even though the pregnancy nearly kills her. Meanwhile, movies like "The Ides of March" present abortion as something that occurs entirely for the convenience of men a political handler learns that an intern with whom he's just had a one-night stand already is pregnant from a one-night stand with his candidate boss, drops her off to have an abortion and she later kills herself. It's uneven, to be sure, but youth culture is witnessing at least some blending of conservative and feminist values that encourage -- not necessarily pressure -- girls to choose either to hold out or embrace motherhood. Huckabee: Women don't need 'Uncle Sugar' NARAL Pres.: abortion restrictions up to states Any room for compromise on abortion Thousands converge for March on Life There is no one explanation but rather a synthesis of medical, cultural and economic forces at work here. All of which paints a far more complex picture than the one we find in politics. Which is disappointing. Many liberals speak of the need for abortion to be "safe, legal and rare," and even Hillary Clinton has called it "sad" and "tragic." But liberal legislators have consistently voted against even the most reasonable attempts to make it rarer; witness the partisan voting in the House o n the recently proposed 20-week abortion ban. Many conservatives, at a national level, still talk in terms of a hypothetical federal ban that would put them up against the Supreme Court and potentially outlaw abortion in the cases when many voters would regard it as a tragic necessity. You may recall, with understandable disgust, Republican conversations about degrees of rape during the last election. It's one of the reasons so many lost. Most Americans do not see abortion in these stark, simplistic terms. If they have slowly trended toward identifying themselves as pro-life, it is probably because the label reflects the flowering of a strong ideal "I'd like there to be no abortions" tempered by a quiet acceptance of reality "But I know they will continue". Who, then, should these citizens vote for As a pro-lifer, I'd love to see a presidential candidate who better reflects the subtleties of what is one of the most painful, nuanced matters of our age -- be it a Republican who talks more about making having a child a positive, affordable decision thanks to better health care or educational opportunities, or a Democrat who says "safe, legal and rare" and actually means it. In the absence of that, we have to trust the people. And it's heartening to see so many more than ever before choosing life. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

<title>Irish Parliament passes exception to abortion ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Irish Parliament passes exception to abortion ban By Michael Martinez and Ben Brumfield, CNN updated 6:47 AM EDT, Fri July 12, 2013 A protester displays a banner against Ireland's abortion laws in Dublin on November 24. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Human Rights Watch says the bill fails women in Ireland by not going far enough The final bill includes a provision allowing abortion if the mother is at risk of suicide The majority government supports the bill Conservative and progressive lawmakers argue over various amendments CNN -- Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly passed new legislation early Friday that allows abortions if the mother's life is at risk. Members of Parliament in the devoutly Catholic country spent hours before its passage debating the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013. The vote was 127-31 in favor of the bill. Conservative and progressive lawmakers argued over amendments to the draft law. Religious lawmakers and church leaders are upset over a provision allowing abortion if a pregnant woman is acutely at risk of committing suicide. They called it a "Trojan horse" leading to easy abortion access and wanted it removed, but the provision was included in the final bill, according to The Irish Times. Ireland abortion bill vote Historic abortion vote planned in Ireland A woman can't just threaten to commit suicide and expect to receive an abortion, according to the bill. Two psychiatrists and an obstetrician must certify that the risk of suicide is "real and substantial." Female lawmakers introduced an amendment to permit abortions if a woman becomes pregnant after incest or rape, but later shelved it when it ran into resistance, the Times reported. In its final provisions, the bill underlines existing Irish laws to protect the fetus. "It shall be an offense to intentionally destroy unborn human life," it reads. A woman who violates the law could face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The bill has proved divisive even within the government. European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton, who was opposed to elements of the legislation, resigned Thursday, Prime Minister Enda Kenny confirmed. Doctors and hospital personnel involved in illegal abortions face the same punishment, according to the bill. The issue was brought to the forefront last year when a 31-year-old woman died after doctors refused to perform a life-saving abortion. Savita Halappanavar went into a hospital in Galway, Ireland, in October, complaining of severe back pain. Doctors established Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, was having a miscarriage. But they did not terminate the pregnancy, afraid the law would not allow it. Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita died of a blood infection. Public outrage over her death likely hastened the passage of the new legislation. It was proposed after a 2010 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, but had been moving slowly through the legislative system. The European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland's failure to regulate access to abortion had led to a violation of its human rights obligations. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never enacted into law, meaning there was little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion could not take place. Human Rights Watch said the new legislation failed Ireland's women by not going far enough to reform the country's abortion laws. It did "the bare minimum" to comply with the European court ruling, and did not address other issues such as the rights of women who are pregnant as a result of rape, it said in a statement. "The new law does add clarity, but requiring women to seek multiple approvals from health professionals may delay or defeat access to legal abortions," said Gauri van Gulik, women's rights advocate for Human Rights Watch. "Ultimately it does little to improve the draconian restrictions on abortions."</text>

<title>Let's get real about abortions - CNN.com</title>
<text>Let's get real about abortions By David Frum, CNN Contributor updated 9:12 AM EDT, Mon October 29, 2012 Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's comment about rape sparked a firestorm of discussion. STORY HIGHLIGHTS David Frum: People often neglect the economic reasons behind the choice to have an abortion He says those trying to reduce abortion need an answer to how to help women in need Frum: Abortion rates fell in 1990s economic boom Germany, which has generous maternity benefits, has much lower abortion rate, he says Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is the author of seven books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002. CNN -- When Richard Mourdock delivered his notorious answer about rape and abortion, I was sorry that the debate moderator failed to follow up with the next question: "OK, Mr. Mourdock, you say your principles require a raped woman to carry the rapist's child to term. That's a heavy burden to impose on someone. What would you do for her in return Would you pay her medical expenses Compensate her for time lost to work Would you pay for the child's upbringing College education "If a woman has her credit card stolen, her maximum liability under federal law is $50. Yet on your theory, if she is raped, she must endure not only the trauma of assault, but also accept economic costs of potentially many thousands of dollars. Must that burden also fall on her alone When we used to draft men into the Army, we gave them veterans' benefits afterward. If the state now intends to conscript women into involuntary childbearing, surely those women deserve at least an equally generous deal" That question sounds argumentative, and I suppose it is. David Frum But there's a serious point here, and it extends well beyond the anguishing question of sexual assault. If you're serious about reducing abortion, the most important issue is not which abortions to ban. The most important issue is how will you support women to have the babies they want. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter . We welcome your ideas and comments. As a general rule, societies that do the most to support mothers and child-bearing have the fewest abortions. Societies that do the least to support mothers and child-bearing have more abortions. Germany, for example, operates perhaps the world's plushest welfare state. Working women receive 14 weeks of maternity leave, during which time they receive pay from the state. The state pays a child allowance to the parents of every German child for potentially as many as 25 years, depending on how long as the child remains in school. Women who leave the work force after giving birth receive a replacement wage from the state for up to 14 months. McCain: Mourdock should say he was wrong Uproar over Mourdock abortion remarks Senate candidate clarifies rape comment Maybe not coincidentally, Germany has one of the lowest abortion rates, about one-third that of the United States. Yet German abortion laws are not especially restrictive. Abortion is legal during the first trimester of pregnancy and available if medically or psychologically necessary in the later trimesters. Even here in the United States, where parental benefits are much less generous, abortion responds to economic conditions. In the prosperous 1990s, abortion rates declined rapidly. In the less prosperous '00s, abortion rates declined more slowly. When the economy plunged into crisis in 2008, abortion rates abruptly rose again . These trends should not surprise anyone. Women choose abortion for one overwhelming reason: economic insecurity. The large majority of women who chose abortion in 2008, 57%, reported a disruptive event in their lives in the previous 12 months: most often, the loss of a job or home. Of the women who choose abortion, 58% are in their 20s. Some 61% of them already have a child. Almost 70% of them are poor or near poor. Three-quarters say they cannot afford another child. Pro-life and pro-choice debaters delight in presenting each other with exquisitely extreme moral dilemmas: "Would you ban abortion even in case of rape" "Would you permit abortion even when done only to select the sex of the child" These dorm-room hypotheticals do not have very much to do with the realities of abortion in the U.S. and elsewhere. Here's an interesting example of those realities: The Netherlands has one of the the most liberal abortion laws in the world. Yet for a long time, the Netherlands also reported one of the world's lowest abortion rates. That low incidence abruptly began to rise in the mid-1990s. Between 1996 and 2003, the abortion rate in the Netherlands jumped by 31% over seven years. What changed The Guttmacher Institute, the leading source of data on reproductive health worldwide, cites "a growing demand for terminations from women in ethnic minority groups residing in the country." Well over half of all abortions performed on teenagers in the Netherlands are performed on girls of non-Dutch origins. These girls and women weren't being raped. They weren't selecting for the sex of their child. They chose abortion because they had become sexually active within male-dominated immigrant subcultures in which access to birth control was restricted, in which female sexuality was tightly policed, in which girls who become pregnant outside marriage are disgraced and in which the costs and obligations of childbearing loaded almost entirely on women alone. Abortion is a product of poverty and maternal distress. A woman who enjoys the most emotional and financial security and who has chosen the timing of her pregnancy will not choose abortion, even when abortion laws are liberal. A woman who is dominated, who is poor and who fears bearing the child is likely to find an abortion, even where abortion is restricted, as it was across the United States before 1965. Santorum: Mourdock criticism 'gotcha politics' So maybe at the next candidates' debate, a journalist will deflect the discussion away from "what if" and instead ask this: "Rather than tell us what you'd like to ban, tell us please what you think government should do to support more happy and healthy childbearing, to reduce unwanted pregnancies and to alleviate the economic anxieties of mothers-to-be" Those are the questions that make the difference. It's amazing how little we talk about them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Part of complete coverage on</text>

<title>Dominican Republic abortion ban stops treatment for pregnant teen with cancer - CNN.com</title>
<text>Dominican Republic abortion ban stops treatment for pregnant teen with cancer By Rafael Romo, Senior Latin American Affairs Editor updated 7:43 AM EDT, Wed July 25, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS A 16-year-old girl with leukemia hasn't received treatment because she's pregnant Article 37 of the Dominican Republic's constitution forbids abortion Chemotherapy for the girl's illness will likely terminate her pregnancy Incident has sparked a renewed debate on abortion laws in the country Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic CNN -- In the Dominican Republic, a ban on abortion is preventing a teenage girl from receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease. At the Semma Hospital in the captial city of Santo Domingo, a 16-year-old girl is dying of acute leukemia. Doctors say the girl, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, needs an aggressive chemotherapy treatment. But there's one problem: the teenager is nine weeks pregnant and treatment would very likely terminate the pregnancy, a violation of Dominican anti-abortion laws. Rosa Hernandez, the girl's mother, is trying to convince doctors and the Dominican government to make an exception so that her daughter's life can be saved. "My daughter's life is first. I know that [abortion] is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first," Hernandez said. According to Article 37 of the Dominican constitution, "the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death." Dominican courts have interpreted this as a strict mandate against abortion. Article 37, passed in 2009, also abolished the death penalty. Turkish women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion Miguel Montalvo, the director of the bioethics council that rules on the application of the law, says the council is leaning toward allowing the treatment. "At the end of the day the patient may decide for himself or herself. In this case, the family may decide what's more convenient for the patient," Montalvo said. Women's and human rights groups are outraged, saying the girl should have received chemotherapy immediately. Lilliam Fondeur, a women's rights activist, complains that conservative politics is preventing necessary treatment to save the teenager's life. "How can it be possible that so much time is being wasted That the treatment hasn't begun yet because they're still meeting, trying to decide if she has the right to receive the treatment to save her life -- that's unacceptable," Fondeur said. Some Dominican opposition lawmakers say there should be a new debate over the abortion ban in the Caribbean country and the problems created by the constitutional ban go beyond this case. Opinion leaders like former representative Victor Terrero say clandestine abortions are also putting the lives of many women at risk. "The constitution is going to have to be modified sooner rather than later," Terrero said. "We cannot allow under any circumstances that pregnancies that present complications for women be permitted to continue as normal." Bautista Rojas Gomez, the Dominican minister of health, has publicly indicated he favors chemotherapy over protecting the pregnancy, but doctors are still reluctant to act for fear of prosecution. Pelegrin Castillo, one of the architects of Article 37, says the constitutional ban does not prevent doctors from administering the treatment. It does, however, prevent them from practicing an abortion in order to treat the patient with chemotherapy. "It's an artificial debate," Castillo said. "What we have clearly said is that in this case doctors are authorized by the constitution to treat the patient. They don't have to worry about anything. They have the mandate of protecting both lives." And while the debate rages on around the country, back at the hospital the clock keeps ticking for the 16-year-old pregnant girl.

<title>Michael Moore: Capitalism has proven it's failed - CNN.com</title>
<text>CNN/Money: Understanding the G20 King: You're in that 1 percent, though Moore: I don't think I'm in that 1 percent, but I make documentary films. But I mean, obviously, I do well because my films have done well. But, you know, even if I were, I think it's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I've done well, that I have to make sure that everybody else. King: Does well too or has a chance Moore: Well, has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs. King: Are you saying capitalism is a failure Moore: Yes. Capitalism. Yes. Well, I don't have to say it. Capitalism, in the last year, has proven that it's failed. All the basic tenets of what we've talked about the free market, about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart. As soon as they lost, essentially, our money, they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare, for socialism. And I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's a sink-or-swim situation. And those who do well, the cream rises to the top and, you know, those who invest their money wrongly or, you know, don't run their business the right way, then they don't do well. Watch Moore talk about corporate greed And if you run your business the wrong way, where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it, because a lot of people were afraid, because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it. I mean, they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people's money -- people's pension funds, people's 401ks. They took this money and they made bets. And then they made bets on the bets. And then they took out insurance policies on the bets. And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps. King: You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up. Moore: Yes. King: The stock market tanked. Now, how did the events, as it occurred, affect the movie Did it change gears Moore: It didn't change in terms of what I was looking at, but it did, obviously, offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it doesn't, it isn't run with democratic -- small "d" -- democratic principles. There's no democracy in our economy. You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run. The upper 1 percent, the people down on Wall Street, the corporate executives, they're the people that control this economy. King: And they don't want to see the economy do well They don't want to see people... Moore: Oh, they sure do. King: Don't they want people to make money so they can buy the products I mean it's silly if they want people unemployed Moore: Oddly enough, yes. King: Why Moore: I'll tell you why. Because your employees are your biggest expense. And, as you've noticed in the last few months, as the unemployment rate has gone up, so has the Dow Jones. Now, you'd think, you know, that Wall Street would respond with "Oh, my God, unemployment is going up, you know, this is bad for business." But the reality is, is that Wall Street likes that. They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit. King: Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee Moore: Yes. The investor -- and the investor, these days, they want the short-term, quick profit and they want it now. But in the long-term, here's what happened. When I was on this show 20 years ago, 20 years ago this week, I was here with "Roger and Me". King: I remember. Moore: And General Motors, that year, made a profit of $4 billion. And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people. Now, why would you lay people off when you're making a record profit of $4 billion I mean that was totally insane. But they thought, well, you know, we can make a bigger profit. Maybe we can make $4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico. And so they're always, you know, we can make a little bit more money if we do this. By firing those workers, Larry, they got rid of the very people who buy their cars.</text>

<title>Campaign 2012: The phony war of markets vs. government - CNN.com</title>
<text>Campaign 2012: The phony war of markets vs. government By Julian Zelizer, CNN Contributor updated 11:05 AM EDT, Mon July 23, 2012 This election is not a choice between government and markets but between priorities within a mix of the two, says Julian Zelizer. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pundits are painting President Obama as the anti-capitalist candidate, says Julian Zelizer But this election is not a choice between government and markets, Zelizer says Liberals have been firm supporters of capitalism, he says Zelizer: Conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of American life Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and of the new book " Governing America ." CNN -- In a recent column for The New York Times, David Brooks argued that the nation has now entered into a "capitalism debate." Brooks wrote that President Obama, who he said is feeling defensive about the failure of his policies to revitalize economic growth, has launched an all-out assault on capitalism by depicting Mitt Romney as the embodiment of corrupt and vicious economic practices. The president's decision to focus on Romney's work at Bain Capital, Brooks argues, has shifted the "focus of the race from being about big government, which Obama represents, to being about capitalism, which Romney represents." Romney responded in kind, "I'm convinced he wants Americans to be ashamed of success." If this shift continues, the campaigns will spend the next four months presenting voters with a false impression about the the real contest. While both parties have a strong incentive to ramp up the rhetoric to mobilize voters to turn out, this kind of campaign features a debate that has little to do with the governing that will actually take place after the election. Julian Zelizer This election is not a choice between government and markets. The reality is that we will continue to have a system that mixes government and markets, with the political battles centering on the particular priorities that the nation emphasizes within that mix. Obama, as Brooks points out, has not really been a critic of free-market capitalism. His policies have done little to challenge the forces of globalization, and he has worked closely with economic leaders in his efforts to fix the economy. His financial regulation did little to curb the freedom of Wall Street investors. Obama is not some kind of exception among American liberals. Indeed, since Franklin Roosevelt, American liberals have been firm supporters of American capitalism. Their goals have been to tame the excesses of this economic system and to make capitalism fairer for all Americans. Many of FDR's economic policies, such as the National Recovery Act, depended on voluntary cooperation from big business. FDR backed away from any proposals that entailed the federal government obtaining strong control over managerial decisions. The point of legitimating unions, which happened through the Wagner Act 1935, was to provide workers with some kind of countervailing power to business owners within the capitalism system. Other Democrats, such as Harry Truman, followed in this market-friendly liberal tradition. Lyndon Johnson offered economic assistance to the poor and educational assistance to all students, so that more people could participate and enjoy the fruits that the capitalist system produced. With his support of deregulation and deficit reduction, Jimmy Carter moved market-based Democrats even further to the center. Bill Clinton embraced globalization and believed that nurturing free markets could offer the best opportunities to those struggling at home and abroad. While liberalism has always been a political system that sought to use government to strengthen the market-based economy, conservatives have usually been comfortable with government. Despite their rhetoric, conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of American life. Romney has been no exception. As governor, he was not some kind of radical slasher of government services. The centerpiece of his term was a bold health care initiative that expanded that role of government in ensuring access to health care. Romney cut services, but he also increased all kinds of government fees. During his current campaign, Romney is not talking about eliminating the big-ticket programs like Social Security, and he has firmly defended robust levels of national security spending. Like Obama, Romney reflects his own political tradition. Libertarianism has long been dead among conservatives. During the Cold War, conservatives like Sen. Barry Goldwater and author James Burnham pushed for the government to spend more on the fight against communism. During the 1970s, historian Gareth Davies recounted, many conservatives came to accept federal programs such as education as an inevitable part of domestic life. President Ronald Reagan, the iconic conservative, quickly backed off proposals like an initiative to reduce certain Social Security benefits when they stimulated a strong political backlash, and he left many other kinds of domestic spending, like Medicare or agricultural subsidies, intact. George H.W. Bush brought the federal government into new areas of domestic life, providing, for example, protections for people with disabilities. Congressional conservatives like Newt Gingrich proved that they were not much different, as they too were aware that Americans in red states often depended on the government they lambasted. George W. Bush and the Republican Congress grew government in the early part of this century. Bush pushed several significant domestic initiatives such as No Child Left Behind and a costly prescription drug benefit. Like all Republicans, he did little to take out the massive welfare state of tax exemptions and deductions upon which many industries depend. In 2008, he saved financial markets through government with TARP, not through deregulation. His homeland security program involved an aggressive expansion of government power, and he launched two wars abroad. Like it or not, liberals have always accepted capitalism, and conservatives have proved more than willing to live with, and even to use, the federal government for certain purposes. The debate today is not between big government and free market capitalism but rather about how we should structure our mixture of these two systems. The more we have these kinds of overblown debates, the less voters get a sense of what politicians are actually about and what they'll do once in power. A more realistic debate would be about which portion of the public will have tax cuts extended. Rather than an all or nothing debate, we should hear which specific parts of the budget will be trimmed and where will each candidate try to find more efficiency in government. In terms of the economy, where and how will they use government to stimulate economic investment and to curb the deficit, how else will candidates try to raise revenue. This current rhetoric is not only unrealistic, it fuels public frustration with government by generating false expectations and providing campaign discussions that have little to do with real life in Washington.</text>

<title>Capitalism: A Love Story Review | Movie Reviews and News | EW.com</title>
<text>EW's GRADE B Details Limited Release: Sep 23, 2009; Rated: R; Length: 117 Minutes; Genre:  Documentary ; With:  Michael Moore ; Distributor:  Overture Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is a blistering, mad-as-hell indictment of everything in America that, according to Moore, has led to our current state of economic peril. The back-scratching greed and corruption, the cult of Wall Street as a casino for elites, the subprime mortgage vendors who operated like loan sharks: Moore pulls the big picture together, and much of the movie about three-fifths of it is urgent, unsettling, and mischievously funny. Yet I wish  oh, how I wish  that Moore had restrained himself from painting America's sins with too broad a brush. Pointing his finger at ''capitalism'' Moore sounds a little too much like Rush Limbaugh getting hot under the collar about ''socialism.'' In both cases, theyâ€™re not making an argument  theyâ€™re demonizing a word. Early on, Moore, who narrates the movie in his trademark tone of bedtime-fairy-tale sarcasm, creates a memorable montage of the '50s and '60s, taking us back to a more secure and, in some ways, egalitarian America. For Moore, the transformative moment was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Capitalism: A Love Story is most potent when it shows us what the financial desperation and ruthless corporate squeezing that descended from that era now look like. There's an astonishing section about companies that take out life-insurance policies on their employees, profiting from their deaths, and Moore squeezes a great deal of symbolic mileage out of the fact that airline pilots have been reduced to beleaguered wage slaves who routinely make less than $20,000 a year. Then there's the federal government's $700 billion bank bailout, which for Moore is a conspiracy, an officially sanctioned robbery. Here, as in the health-care doc Sicko 2007, Moore's real subject is the collapse of the social contract. That's a powerful theme, but why did he have to make the film's villain nothing less thanâ€¦capitalism itself Moore depicts the very concept of American free enterprise as inherently unjust. But even if you believe that deregulation in the '80s went too far, that unchecked capitalism is a voracious beast that can eat a culture alive, you may have a hard time swallowing the film's finale, in which Moore trashes our system as ''evil'' and pushes for a citizens' ''revolt.'' At its best, Capitalism: A Love Story is a searing outcry against the excesses of a cutthroat time. At its worst, it's dorm-room Marxism. B</text>

<text>Ahmadinejad blames capitalism for global woes By the CNN Wire Staff Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is on a public relations offensive in New York, addressing the session on tackling world poverty. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ahmadinejad says the world needs to revert to a "divine mind-set" His visit is not without protest He has suggested the U.S. release Iranians he says are illegally arrested He will appear on CNN's "Larry King Live" Wednesday United Nations CNN -- Attending a United Nations session on alleviating world poverty Tuesday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed capitalism for the world's woes. "The demanding liberal capitalism and transnational corporations have caused the suffering of countless women, men and children in so many countries," Ahmadinejad said at a U.N. General Assembly session on the Millennium Development Goals. "It is my firm belief that in the new millennium, we need to revert to the divine mind-set, to our true nature for which man was created and, indeed, to the just and fair governance," he said. At past global conferences, Ahmadinejad's strong words against Israel have prompted world leaders to walk out. But the hard-line Iranian leader's comments Tuesday were relatively tempered. "Now that the discriminatory order of capitalism and the hegemonic approaches are facing defeat and are getting close to their end, all-out participation in upholding justice and prosperous interrelations is essential," he said. Video: Peres: Peace will succeed Video: U.N. agenda: Poverty, Afghanistan Video: Sarah Shourd's homecoming Video: Sarah Shourd's bittersweet return Ahmadinejad is on a public relations offensive this week in New York, addressing the session on tackling world poverty, giving interviews and speaking again Thursday in the assembly's general debate. On Wednesday he will appear on CNN's "Larry King Live." His visit coincides with the homecoming of American Sarah Shourd, who was accused of spying against Iran and detained in a Tehran prison for 14 months. Ahmadinejad has suggested the Obama administration ought to return the humanitarian gesture by releasing Iranians he says were illegally arrested and detained in the United States. The United States says the cases are not related. Ahmadinejad shared the stage Tuesday with world leaders, among them Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. His appearance at the United Nations comes just three months after the Security Council imposed tough new sanctions on Iran to try to force it to suspend its nuclear program. Iran is also under global scrutiny for alleged human rights violations in a crackdown on dissent following last year's disputed elections that returned Ahmadinejad to the presidency. The summit on the Millennium Development Goals is assessing the successes of eight measurable goals set a decade ago that were intended to help halve extreme poverty and alleviate hunger and disease by 2015.

<title>CNN.com - Drowning out 'karaoke capitalism' - Mar 31, 2004</title>
<text>Manage alerts | What is this CNN -- Repetition, standardized recipes and replication are the norm in many business sectors; whether it be mid-sized cars, marketed music, architecture or movie remakes. According to two business gurus, the corporate world is now under siege from "karaoke capitalism" or institutionalized imitation, where copycat firms dominate. "No matter how talented you are in a karaoke bar, you are going to end up being a pale copy of an original," Jonas Ridderstrale told CNN. "We need to realize it is better to be a first rate version of yourself, rather than a second class copy of someone else." The 2003, Thinkers 50 -- the worlds' first ranking of management luminaries -- pegged Dr. Jonas Ridderstrale and Dr. Kjell Nordstrom at number 21. Their brand of business philosophy says companies can only achieve success if they think and act differently from their competitors. "Competing in a world of karaoke capitalism is about daring to be different, it is about writing the songs of the future and not focusing on the tunes of the past," explains Ridderstale. They both look nothing like business school professors and delight in Scandinavian dryness, throwing in philosophy and pop culture into seminars, as well as reveling in firms who raise themselves above the madding crowd. "Dell and Virgin want to change something, make certain parts of society work better or improve a product," explains Nordstrom. Their mantra says that for many consumers in Europe and the U.S., life-long loyalty to a country, a company, a brand, a rock band, a husband or a wife has vanished and people no longer accept standardization in their lives and purchases. "64 percent of all marriages in Sweden end in divorce. From the start people no longer have a sense of loyalty," says Ridderstrale. "If I require a flat made for me -- I do not want a fridge, I want an ice machine. I do not need a bathtub. I prefer two showers." The two Swedes are the authors of international bestsellers "Funky Business" and now "Karaoke Capitalism: Talent makes capital dance." In their latest book they describe the new reality for most corporations -- a consumer landscape under siege from increasingly powerful individuals, who are free to know, go, do and be who they want to be.

<title>Opinion: Bonus waiver a sad day for capitalism - CNN.com</title>
<text>Opinion: Bonus waiver a sad day for capitalism By David Buik, for CNN updated 5:51 AM EST, Tue January 31, 2012 Stephen Hester, chief executive officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland RBS, as pictured in London in November. STORY HIGHLIGHTS David Buik says little correlation between role and remuneration of chairman and CEO He believes political expediency and public opinion bullied Hester into waiving bonus Buik says Hester has done a good job at RBS He says it is shame that Hester's case has not been objectively presented Editor's note: Editor's note: David Buik has spent almost 50 years in the City of London, as an investment banker and broker. He is a partner at BGC Partners and a frequent media commentator on financial matters. CNN -- The announcement on Sunday night that Stephen Hester, the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, had bowed to political pressure in the UK and decided to waive his bonus -- worth £963,000 $1.5M in shares -- will turn out to be a very sad day for commercial democracy. The UK taxpayer, through the government, owns 82% of RBS, after bailing it out in 2008. If there had been any concern about the democratic process, then UK Financial Investments -- which manages the government-aided financial institutions -- and the UK Treasury should have filled the RBS board with their appointees at the time, rather than rely on commercial appointments under the chairmanship of Philip Hampton. David Buik, partner at BGC Partners Hampton's credentials as RBS chairman look exemplary to me: he is formerly chairman of retail giant J Sainsbury, finance director of BG Group and holds board positions at Lloyds Bank and BG Group. If ever a person is qualified to make sure the job was being done, then Hampton is as good a candidate as any. He took a personal decision at the weekend to waive his own bonus -- but that probably did not help Hester's cause. There is very little correlation between the role and the remuneration of a chairman and a CEO. A chairman's job is to make sure that the board's policy is complied with: the CEO's job is to form that policy and execute it. The fact remains that political expediency and public opinion in the UK have bullied Hester into waiving his justified bonus. There is no doubt that opposition Labour lawmakers and the Lib-Dems, the minority party in the ruling UK coalition government, would have won any parliamentary vote ordering the rescinding of Hester's board-approved emolument. Such a vote may not have necessitated RBS to change its mind about Hester's bonus but it would have made his position untenable. Hester's job at RBS during the past three years has not been made any easier by the incompetence of EU politicians, whose inept and moribund approach to the sovereign debt crisis has trashed the banking sector's value. This level of incompetence has taken the EU and the UK to the brink of recession. What bank in its right mind would lend money to counterparties, which may not be able to repay Many, like me, think Hester has done a very good job. The bank will be in profit this year 2011 for maybe £2 billion against a loss of £1.6 billion last year and a gargantuan loss of £26 billion in 2009. The balance sheet under his stewardship has been cut from £2.2 trillion by circa £700 billion. The investment banking division is being wound down. Corporate broker Hoare Govett may be sold to Jeffries of the U.S. this week to include only about 50 people. Bonuses will drop substantially at RBS next year. Yes, there will be a furore over the bonuses due to John Hourican of ABN/AMRO and Ellen Alenamy of Citizens Bank, who are both owned by RBS -- but that has little to do with a CEO's compensation package. I hope that Hester does not resign -- but frankly he has grounds to. The support of his political masters looks very flaky. The job is immensely stressful. Does he need the grief if the support is not there Frankly, the office of CEO has been rubbished by the unparalleled pressure heaped on Hester by UK politicians, who understandably pander to public opinion. It is such a shame that Hester's case has not been objectively presented. It is quite unfair that his bonus should be used as the yardstick for investment banking bonus culture as Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, would have us believe. The £1.2 million salary is cast in stone: Hester needs to keep a team of the best people incentivized so that the taxpayer gets its £45 billion returned pretty damn quick. The bonuses awarded to Hester are only meaningful if RBS's share price rises, resulting in the UK taxpayer being repaid. That strikes me as pragmatic and sensible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Buik.</text>

<title>CNN.com - The suicide of capitalism - Jul 18, 2006</title>
<text>Molly Ivins is a nationally syndicated columnist. The suicide of capitalism Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Washington Manage Alerts | What Is This AUSTIN, Texas CREATORS -- In case you haven't got anything else to worry about -- like war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming or Apocalypse Now -- how about the suicide of capitalism Late last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down a new rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mandatory registration with the SEC for most hedge funds. This may not strike you as the end of the world, but that's because you've either forgotten what a hedge fund is or how much trouble they can get us into. These investment pools for rich folks are now a $1.2 trillion industry known to insiders, I am pleased to report, as "the hedge fund community". Hedge funds are now beginning to be used by average investors and pension investors. Back in 1998, there was this little-bitty old hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management. Because hedge funds make high-risk bets, Long Term Capital got itself in so much trouble its collapse actually threatened to wreck world markets, and regulators had to step in to negotiate a $3.6 billion bailout. A similar fiasco at this point probably would break world markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission under William Donaldson appointed after the Enron mess had tried to regulate hedge funds. But Christopher Cox, current SEC chairman and no friend of regulation, said he would consult other members of the administration about whether to appeal the ruling, which "came on the same day as disclosures," reports The Washington Post, that the feds "are investigating Pequot Capital Management, Inc., a $7 billion hedge fund, for possible insider trading." Nice timing, judges. This is the third time in less than a year the appeals court has blocked the SEC from acting beyond its authority. According to The Washington Post, "Former SEC member Harvey J. Goldschmid, who voted to approve the plan, yesterday urged regulators to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, members of Congress or both. In the Pequot case, a former SEC lawyer who worked on the Pequot investigation before being fired by the agency has written a letter to key members of the Senate banking and finance committees alleging that the SEC dropped the probe because of political pressure." The lawyer said he was prevented by political pressure from interviewing a top Wall Street executive: Sources said the executive was John J. Mack, once chairman of Pequot and now chief executive of Morgan Stanley -- and a major fundraiser for President Bush's campaigns. I'd say the guy's wired. So what we have here is yet another case of ideological decision-making "all government regulation is bad" being applied despite the most obvious promptings of common sense. Come to think of it, that's exactly the same pattern this administration has followed with war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming and Apocalypse Now. Well, if the administration won't do something, how about Congress Reps. Barney Frank, Michael Capuano and Paul Kanjorski are co-sponsoring a bill to reverse the court decision -- and to gather more information about how hedge funds affect the economy.

<sentence cont= 1>The suicide of capitalism Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Washington Manage Alerts | What Is This AUSTIN, Texas CREATORS -- In case you haven't got anything else to worry about -- like war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming or Apocalypse Now -- how about the suicide of capitalism Late last month, the U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Court of Appeals struck down a new rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mandatory registration with the SEC for most hedge funds.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>This may not strike you as the end of the world, but that's because you've either forgotten what a hedge fund is or how much trouble they can get us into.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >These investment pools for rich folks are now a $1.2 trillion industry known to insiders, I am pleased to report, as "the hedge fund community".</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Hedge funds are now beginning to be used by average investors and pension investors.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Back in 1998, there was this little-bitty old hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Because hedge funds make high-risk bets, Long Term Capital got itself in so much trouble its collapse actually threatened to wreck world markets, and regulators had to step in to negotiate a $3.6 billion bailout.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >A similar fiasco at this point probably would break world markets.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Securities and Exchange Commission under William Donaldson appointed after the Enron mess had tried to regulate hedge funds.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>But Christopher Cox, current SEC chairman and no friend of regulation, said he would consult other members of the administration about whether to appeal the ruling, which "came on the same day as disclosures," reports The Washington Post, that the feds "are investigating Pequot Capital Management, Inc., a $7 billion hedge fund, for possible insider trading." Nice timing, judges.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >This is the third time in less than a year the appeals court has blocked the SEC from acting beyond its authority.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >According to The Washington Post, "Former SEC member Harvey J.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Goldschmid, who voted to approve the plan, yesterday urged regulators to appeal to the U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Supreme Court, members of Congress or both.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>In the Pequot case, a former SEC lawyer who worked on the Pequot investigation before being fired by the agency has written a letter to key members of the Senate banking and finance committees alleging that the SEC dropped the probe because of political pressure."

<sentence cont=0 >Mack, once chairman of Pequot and now chief executive of Morgan Stanley -- and a major fundraiser for President Bush's campaigns.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>I'd say the guy's wired.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >So what we have here is yet another case of ideological decision-making "all government regulation is bad" being applied despite the most obvious promptings of common sense.</sentence>

<text>Researchers to animal-rights activists: We're not afraid Story Highlights 3 research scientists assail animal-rights activists for threats, acts of violence Researchers say their cars and homes have been firebombed They describe the threats, acts of violence as a form of terrorism Spokesman for rights group counters the researchers are terrorizing animals By Thomas G. Watkins CNN CNN -- Three research scientists have taken a rare public stand against animal-rights activists, describing them as terrorists for their threats and acts of violence in commentaries published in the latest issue of The Journal of Neuroscience. Three researchers say they are going to stand up against animal-rights activists who use extreme tactics. Since 2003, "we have seen our cars and homes firebombed or flooded, and we have received letters packed with poisoned razors and death threats via e-mail and voice mail," wrote Dario L. Ringach, a professor of neurobiology and psychology, and J. David Jentsch, a professor of psychology. They work at the University of California, Los Angeles. "Adding insult to injury, misguided animal-rights militants openly incite others to violence on the Internet, brag about the resulting crimes, and go as far as to call plots for our assassination 'morally justifiable,' " they wrote. In telephone interviews with CNN, both men said they had been subject to harassment, threats and violence. Last March, "they blew up my car while it was parked in front of my home at 4 a.m.," said Jentsch, who uses rodents and nonhuman primates in his research into how brain chemistry influences mental disorders. His 2006 Volvo was destroyed. The Animal Liberation Brigade, which took responsibility for the attack in a Web site posting, announced "when we come back, it's not going to be the car, hint, hint," Jentsch said. He said an FBI investigator described the incendiary device as "sophisticated." "We have to take them on directly" The practice long followed by many researchers of keeping quiet and hoping the activists will go away does not work, said the 37-year-old scientist. "We have to take them on directly; that's what we plan to do ... I'm not going to be afraid of these people; they're thugs." Jentsch said the university has provided him with round-the-clock security, along with a handful of other researchers who have been threatened. He acknowledged that having no children may make such a stand easier to take. "People ask me all the time: 'What should people who have children do' " he said. "My only answer is -- what a horrible position to put someone in where they have to choose between their family and their career, their desire to make the world a better place through their science." That was the decision faced by Ringach, who previously worked with primates. Three years ago, when his 6-year-old and 2-year-old children were asleep, 30 to 40 masked activists arrived at their house and banged on the doors and windows, he said. "I just called 911," he said. "I really was terrified; my kids were clinging to my wife." Ringach gave up his work with animals. Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act of 2006 As a result of that incident, Congress passed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act of 2006. It's a federal law that prohibits interference with animal enterprises, including research. But it is being challenged as unconstitutional and, "so far, I'm not sure it has had an effect on their activities," Ringach said. The activists have not limited their attacks to primate researchers. Last year, at the University of California at Santa Cruz, a researcher who works with mice was awakened at dawn with his wife and their two children when their house was firebombed. They escaped. That day, another researcher at the same school -- who works with flies and has not been identified publicly -- had his car set afire, said Ringach. "They're really against all types of research," Ringach said. The Foundation for Biomedical Research said it was aware of 317 incidents of extremist activity by animal rights activists from 1997 to 2008, including firebombings of researchers' homes and cars, breaking and entering, vandalism, stealing property and acts of intimidation. Scientists bear part of the responsibility for not having explained to the public why their work is important, Ringach said. "I would really like to have an honest and civil debate about animal research," he said. "The problem is it's very difficult to do when every day I have to look under my car and see if something is there." Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, noted that rewards of up to $115,000 have been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the bombings. She said law enforcement officials consider the attacks to be acts of domestic terrorism. Taking it to the next level Dr. Jerry Vlasak, a surgeon and spokesman for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, an animal-rights group, said it is the researchers who are the terrorists. "They take these sentient and intelligent beings and lock them up in sealed cages ... and eventually kill them and chop them up in little pieces." Asked whether he supports the use of violence in furthering his goals, he likened his mission to those of anti-apartheid and civil rights activists. "I understand why they're willing to do things like that when all attempts at public discourse and reason and discussion have been quashed," he said. "I understand why people would take it to the next level." In a separate commentary in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Society for Neuroscience's outgoing chairman of the Committee on Animals in Research, Jeffrey H. Kordower, called for the National Institutes of Health to ensure the safety of researchers against animal-rights activists. The federal government requires recipients of NIH grants, primarily universities, to have plans to protect patients undergoing clinical trials and to protect animals used in research. But there is no plan to protect researchers, he said in a telephone interview. The request "has fallen on deaf ears," said Kordower, a neurologist who directs the Research Center for Brain Repair at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. Though no one has been hurt, "the ... potential is that someone will be hurt in the near future," he said. Dr. Sally Rockey, acting NIH deputy director for extramural research, defended her organization's efforts. "As we have previously stated, the NIH is extremely concerned about acts of domestic terrorism against biomedical researchers," she said in a written statement. "In collaboration with the biomedical community, we have developed resources to help our grantee institutions prepare for and manage crises. NIH will continue its commitment to this policy in the interests of the safety of the researchers whose work it supports." The issue is a critical one if science is to advance, said Society for Neuroscience President Thomas J. Carew. "Responsible animal research has played a vital role in nearly every major medical advance of the last century, from heart disease to polio, and is essential for future advances as well," he said in a written statement. "Today, it is unacceptable that, in the pursuit of better health and understanding of disease, researchers, their families and their communities face violence and intimidation by extremists." Charges and countercharges Vlasak said he had submitted a letter to the editor to The Journal of Neuroscience that said, "As unfortunate as it may be, all successful liberation struggles have had to incorporate the use of force in addition to rational and educated argument; after all, an oppressor never gives up his power until left with no alternative." Vlasak said Journal editor John Maunsell rejected the letter, telling Vlasak in an e-mail, "We will not publish responses from commentators that appear to condone or encourage violence." That sparked this missive from Vlasak back to Maunsell: "David Jentsch can torture and kill nonhuman primates year after year in his laboratory to allegedly study human addiction, but I refer to the historical use of force to overthrow oppression and you censor my letter "You wallow in hypocrisy, and refuse to acknowledge the suffering of any being besides those of your own species. Your attitudes and behavior will ensure the struggle continues, and hopefully escalates to encompass ever-more effective strategies." Vlasak provided CNN with copies of his e-mail correspondence with Maunsell. A spokeswoman for the journal said it does not comment on potential submissions. In a joint comment e-mailed to CNN, Jentsch and Ringach said, "It is not acceptable for Dr. Vlasak to talk about civilized public discourse out of one side of his mouth and describe violence against us as just and reasonable out of the other. "People like him have deceived the public about the nature and benefits of biomedical research and, at the same time, we think his behavior has hindered the work of legitimate animal rights/welfare groups. "It is critical that 'mainstream' groups sever their ties with violent individuals within their movement and publicly repudiate the acts of animal-right extremists and those that incite them from the sidelines. When that happens, scientists and animal advocates can get together to have a reasoned and civilized dialogue about these important issues." The outspoken researchers are not alone. More than 10,000 people -- many of them scientists -- have signed a "Pro-Test Petition" that credits animal research with having "contributed ... to major advances in the length and quality of our lives." It adds that "violence, intimidation and harassment of scientists and others involved in animal research is neither a legitimate means of protest, nor morally justified."</text>

<title>CNN.com - Group blasts PETA 'Holocaust' project - Feb. 28, 2003</title>
<text>Group blasts PETA 'Holocaust' project Story Tools PETA's comparison of the Nazi Holocaust to the slaughter of animals for food is: An effective argument for animal rights An unfair and outrageous comparison VIEW RESULTS CNN -- The Anti-Defamation League has denounced a campaign by an animal rights group that compares slaughtering animals to the murder of 6 million Jews in World War II. The graphic campaign and exhibit "Holocaust on Your Plate," devised by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, juxtaposes 60-square-foot panels displaying gruesome scenes from Nazi death camps side by side with disturbing photographs from factory farms and slaughterhouses. One shows a starving man in a concentration camp next to a starving cow. The exhibit opens Friday in San Diego, California, and went up Thursday at the University of California at Los Angeles. It also is posted on a PETA Web site, www.masskilling.com, which calls for support for the campaign from the Jewish community. The comparisons prompted an angry statement from Abraham Foxman, Anti-Defamation League national director and a Holocaust survivor. "The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent," the statement said. "PETA's effort to seek approval for their 'Holocaust on Your Plate' campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights." Lisa Lange, PETA's vice president of communications, told CNN's "American Morning With Paula Zahn" on Friday that the idea for the public relations effort came from the late Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, who, she said, wrote: "In relation to them [animals], all people are Nazis; for them it is an eternal Treblinka" -- a death camp in Poland. Lange said the campaign is appropriate because "Nazi concentration camps were modeled after slaughterhouses." The Singer quote, which the group draws upon in its literature as well, was not spoken directly by him but rather comes from his novel "Enemies: A Love Story," when the main character muses on the plight of animals. Singer was a vegetarian who believed strongly in animal rights. "It's shocking, it's startling, it's very hard to look at," Lange said of the exhibit. "We're attacking the mind-set" that condones the slaughter of animals. "The very same mind-set that made the Holocaust possible -- that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' -- is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day," PETA representative Mark Prescott wrote in a statement, which added that members of Prescott's family were murdered by Nazis. The Anti-Defamation League statement, however, counters that "abusive treatment of animals should be opposed, but cannot and must not be compared to the Holocaust." Story Tools</text>

<title>ASIANOW - TIME Asia | India: Is Nothing Sacred? | 5/29/2000</title>
<text>INDIA: Holy Cow! Animal-rights activists expose the barbaric transport and slaughter of the country's most revered beasts The campaign against the practice is attracting support from a number of animal-activist celebrities. Paul McCartney, Brigitte Bardot, Steven Seagal and Nina Hagen took part in an international day of protest two weeks ago in their home countries. "My heart breaks for the misery endured by all the mother cows and their calves ... who have become throw-aways in today's India," McCartney declared. The $1.6 billion Indian leather export industry is feeling the pinch. Gap and its subsidiaries Banana Republic and Old Navy have banned the use of Indian leather in their garments. The British shoe company Clark's announced last week that it will review the purchase of products made from Indian leather. PETA's hit list also includes Florsheim, Nordstrom, Casual Corner and other retail chains. "It's a wake-up call to India's leather industry," says PETA's Indian campaign coordinator Jason Baker. "If it doesn't do something soon to stop the cruelty against cows, there will be no leather industry left." India's leather barons are worried that the protests will cripple exports to the West. Nearly 4,000 tanneries and leather-goods factories depend on the export trade. The industry employs around 1.7 million people, nearly a third of whom are women. "The campaign is going to affect us, no doubt about it," says Mohammed Hashim, chairman of the Council for Leather Exports. He feels his tribe is unfairly targeted. "We're only scavengers," he says. "We take skins sold by slaughter houses." Moreover, he adds, 90% of the hides council members use are from buffalo, goats or sheep. His organization has appealed to exporters to use only leather from animals that have been killed humanely. The government, though, shows no sign of moving against the illegal transport and slaughter. Before PETA's campaign, Indian animal-rights groups had been trying for years to stop the brutal cattle trail. It's a multimillion-dollar business, and the kickbacks to politicians and officials are thought to be huge. The cow "death trains" are operated by the state-owned railway. Banning cow slaughter in West Bengal and Kerala probably wouldn't help, as it would surely lead to an increase in the number of illegal, backstreet slaughter houses. New Delhi may simply find it easier to respond to other demands by animal lovers, like creating a national authority for protecting cows or introducing tougher penalties for cruelty to animals under existing law, the fine is only about $1. A simpler solution would be to lift the ban on cow slaughter throughout India, to deter the deadly, illegal herdings across state lines. "Villagers can't afford to keep unproductive cows. They're not saints," says Bangalore animal-welfare worker Suparna Baksi-Ganguly. "Slaughter has to be made more accessible--suppressing it causes greater misery to the animals." But such a step would provoke the ire of cow lovers, and no political party is likely to risk that. So in a land that venerates them, cows will continue to pay a high price for their holiness.

<title>An animal lover's Olympic nightmare - CNN.com</title>
<text>An animal lover's Olympic nightmare Story Highlights Clamp down on stray cats and animals in China's capital leading up to Olympics Qin Xiaona runs organization to help protect Beijing's estimated 200,000 stray cats Animal welfare still generally seen as 'alternative' idea, but 600 support Qin's group By Steven Jiang For CNN "Beijing Journal" is an occasional series examining China's capital as it prepares for the 2008 Summer Games. BEIJING, China CNN -- Qin Xiaona used to visit the suburban Xiaotangshan Sanatorium in the summer to escape the scorching temperature in the city. Now she comes here to turn up the heat on a subject close to her heart. Animal rights advocate Qin Xiaona mixes leftovers to feed stray cats. "This is our experiment to save the city's stray cats," said the 62-year-old retired TV journalist, as she carried two plastic containers full of leftovers out of her villa surrounded by lush greenery. Calling out a dozen snoozing cats by the bushes, Qin watched them rush over and devour the rice mixed with pork and fish. Qin, who heads the Capital Animal Welfare Association, estimates there are some 200,000 stray cats in Beijing, after her group spent more than two years studying the population. She detailed the precarious state of the felines in an 80,000-word report and decided to start her rescue mission with the 72 cats roaming the sanatorium's sprawling ground. "The health bureau runs this place and agreed to let us take care of the cats," Qin said, lifting up a female kitten to check the healing of the surgery wound on its stomach. "We have already neutered and vaccinated a third of them." "We convinced the health officials that stray cats could be a more effective and environmentally friendly way of rodent control than placing 15 tons of rat poisons across the city every year," she explained. This is the kind of win-win solution that Qin hopes to replicate throughout the capital, where stray animals are frequently culled by the government on fears of spreading diseases or attacking humans. For Qin and other members of her NGO, saving stray cats is just one uphill battle in their war against animal cruelty in a culture that often treats man's four-legged friends with little favor. For over 15 years and with meager funding, they have been setting up shelters to house abandoned pets, persuading restaurants to take dog meat off the menus and, most importantly, lobbying legislators to pass an animal welfare law -- a goal that nevertheless remains distant. "Many in the government and society still consider us peripheral and alternative -- and don't recognize and approve our work," Qin said. When Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics seven years ago, she and fellow activists perceived a perfect catalyst in expanding animal rights. To their dismay, the authorities have since stepped up their campaigns against animals -- pets and strays alike -- aimed at "cleaning up" the city for the Games. In 2006 Beijing implemented a controversial "one family, one dog" rule for urban households and required such pet dogs no taller than 35 centimeters 14 inches. Don't Miss Beijing journal:  The series "It is such a ridiculous law," Qin raised her voice, still livid. "Anyone with a little understanding of animals would know that the temperament of dogs has nothing to do with their size, but depends on their breed and training." Although official policies are difficult to modify, Qin feels her efforts have slowly changed the minds of many ordinary citizens. "People's attitude toward animals reflects their attitude toward fellow human beings," she offered. "We should promote love, not hatred, from an early age on." Qin has seen more young people grow receptive to the concept of animal welfare and now also counts some unlikely volunteers -- including a former policewoman -- among her 600-strong group. With the Olympics around the corner, however, Qin has become jittery amid reports of an intensifying government crackdown on animals. "I feel my heart is in my throat," she admitted. "Many officials get money and quotas for culling -- they simply find it so much easier than caring for animals." As she finished feeding the cats at the sanatorium, Qin received a phone call from an animal lover living in a residential compound near the Olympic district. "They are crying for help for the 30 stray cats there," she said. "They have neutered and vaccinated 90 percent of those cats, but officials still sealed the cats in the basement with cement because of health and safety concerns during the Games." Frantically dialing, Qin tried to reach the right person before time ran out for the felines. "Innocent animals shouldn't have to pay the ultimate price for the Olympics," she said.</text>

<title>Bob Barker touts bill to protect traveling circus animals - CNN.com</title>
<text>Bob Barker touts bill to protect traveling circus animals From Stacey Samuel, CNN updated 11:09 PM EDT, Wed November 2, 2011 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Bob Barker urges passage of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act In a Capitol Hill news conference, he tells of violence used to train animals Animal protection advocate tells of confined lives of large show animals Actress Jorga Fox: "Our kids look to us to do what is right" Washington CNN -- Bob Barker, the former host of "The Price Is Right," made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses. At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty. "How do they train them They have to dominate the animal," Barker said. "How do they dominate the animal They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. They shock it with all sorts of electric devices. They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks." Barker, who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection, is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act. The bill, which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act, has attracted bipartisan support. The bill would affect only traveling shows. It specifically exempts zoos, aquariums and research labs and rodeos. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans, "how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation's moral character." Dr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most, if not all, lions, tigers and elephants in traveling shows: "Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed." But the concerns are not confined to their housing. Jan Creamer, president of ADI, said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment. Barker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of "CSI" and "The West Wing," who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road. "Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun. ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd actually be very disappointed in us, for [going] to these places," Fox said. A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation. Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and India. And, according to the panel, more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit. "It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing," Barker said.</text>

<title>Animal rights activists, UCLA researchers square off at protest - CNN.com</title>
<text>Animal rights activists, UCLA researchers square off at protest Story Highlights Dr. David Jentsch joins protest after his car was firebombed last month Activists condemn use of animals as subjects for medical research Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars Jentsch: "This is terror. There is no two ways about it. It's extremism" From Chuck Conder CNN Producer LOS ANGELES, California -- On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, "Stand up for science!" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, "U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. "This is terror," Jentsch said. "There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate." It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. "We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt," said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. "The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce." Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth "There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt," he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. "What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls," he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either. Watch people against animal research at protest » "The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country," he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals. Watch supporters of animal research at protest » Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, "but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity." In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. "I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work," he said. "I'm not going to stop."</text>

<title>Videos renew debate on military use of animals - CNN.com</title>
<text>Videos renew debate on military use of animals Story Highlights Group obtains military videos under Freedom of Information Act Use of animals in military medical training is illegal, group claims Military says regulations followed, alternatives are explored Former medic says training with live animals "definitely" an asset CNN -- Newly released videos are raising questions about the military's continued use of live animals in simulated battlefield medical training. In the military training video, a monkey is monitored after being given a simulated nerve agent. The military training videos were acquired by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine under the Freedom of Information Act. The PCRM claims the videos, which show the use of monkeys and goats in medical training, are evidence that the military is violating its own animal-welfare regulations. Military officials counter that the training is legal and vital to saving the lives of service members in the field. In one of the training videos, a live vervet monkey is anesthetized and then injected with a dose of physostigmine, a simulated nerve agent. The drug simulates some of the effects of a nerve agent, including increased perspiration, muscle spasms and difficulty in breathing. The military says trainees observe the effects of the physostigmine and then take steps to relieve them, injecting the animal with an antidote. The animal's complete recovery takes about 90 minutes, according to the military. "The animals recover completely and display no behavioral or physical ill effects from the exercise," a military spokesman said in an e-mail about the procedure. "No animal has ever died as a result of the exercise." In another video, a medical instructor uses a scalpel to slice open the leg of an anesthetized goat. The video goes on to show medical personnel applying a tourniquet and then dressing the wound. A third video shows a chest tube being inserted into an anesthetized goat. Jamie Campbell, a former U.S. Army medic, says the use of animals in medical training was "most definitely" an asset to him. "It was something you can't experience anywhere else," Campbell told CNN. "As of right now I don't believe there are simulations that can simulate the combat environment," Campbell said. "Patients move, arteries retract, the feel of blood, the feel of muscle, the feel of tissue -- that's something I don't feel a manikin or a video can simulate." Campbell did say, however, that the use of monkeys in simulated nerve-agent exercises might not be necessary. "With this type of scenario, an alternative may be able to be used. You know convulsions. You know vomiting, things that can be acted out ... this is something I think they could find an alternative to." The former medic also said that no amount of training can truly replicate real combat. "Working on an animal -- although it replicates a lot of the injuries -- it can never replicate working on the guy you talked to a half-hour ago. Or working on the person who showed you pictures of his daughter," Campbell said. "But working on the goat trained a lot of medics to save lives, and without that training, how many more casualties would we have had" The PCRM argues that the use of monkeys and goats in the exercises is against military policy and that alternative training methods are available. "Battlefield medics and others caring for our troops should receive state-of-the-art, human-centered training," the PCRM's Hope Ferdowsian said in a news release. "Training with goats and monkeys is inhumane and violates military animal welfare regulations. It also offers an inferior educational experience. "Treating a goat with an artificially created wound is very different from caring for a human casualty," Ferdowsian added. The PCRM, joined by 17 former military doctors and medics, has filed a Petition for Enforcement with the Army surgeon general and other military leaders to halt the practices. The organization says one of the former military doctors calling for a halt to the practices is retired U.S. Navy Capt. Charles Rosciam of the Medical Service Corps. Rosciam served 13 months in combat and treated more than 100 casualties, the PCRM says. Military officials say the use of animals is conducted under strict compliance with animal welfare regulations. "We are dedicated to employing the best available training techniques to prepare our medical care providers to treat battlefield injuries while minimizing the use of live animals," the military spokesman said. "To this end, the Medical Chemical Biological Casualty course makes extensive use of manikins and computer-based training."</text>

<sentence cont=0 >In one of the training videos, a live vervet monkey is anesthetized and then injected with a dose of physostigmine, a simulated nerve agent.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The drug simulates some of the effects of a nerve agent, including increased perspiration, muscle spasms and difficulty in breathing.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The military says trainees observe the effects of the physostigmine and then take steps to relieve them, injecting the animal with an antidote.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The animal's complete recovery takes about 90 minutes, according to the military.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The animals recover completely and display no behavioral or physical ill effects from the exercise," a military spokesman said in an e-mail about the procedure.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"No animal has ever died as a result of the exercise." In another video, a medical instructor uses a scalpel to slice open the leg of an anesthetized goat.</sentence>

<sentence cont=1 >"It was something you can't experience anywhere else," Campbell told CNN.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"As of right now I don't believe there are simulations that can simulate the combat environment," Campbell said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Patients move, arteries retract, the feel of blood, the feel of muscle, the feel of tissue -- that's something I don't feel a manikin or a video can simulate." Campbell did say, however, that the use of monkeys in simulated nerve-agent exercises might not be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"With this type of scenario, an alternative may be able to be used.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >You know convulsions.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >You know vomiting, things that can be acted out . this is something I think they could find an alternative to." The former medic also said that no amount of training can truly replicate real combat.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Working on an animal -- although it replicates a lot of the injuries -- it can never replicate working on the guy you talked to a half-hour ago.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Or working on the person who showed you pictures of his daughter," Campbell said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"But working on the goat trained a lot of medics to save lives, and without that training, how many more casualties would we have had" The PCRM argues that the use of monkeys and goats in the exercises is against military policy and that alternative training methods are available.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Battlefield medics and others caring for our troops should receive state-of-the-art, human-centered training," the PCRM's Hope Ferdowsian said in a news release.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Training with goats and monkeys is inhumane and violates military animal welfare regulations.</sentence>

<text>Border fence is a dividing line in immigration debate Story Highlights Eight Democrats in Congress wrote Obama to halt building of border fence Border Patrol agents say fence has drastically cut number of border crossings Then-Sen. Obama voted to authorize almost $3 billion for building 670 miles of fence Critic says barrier has forced illegal immigrants to make riskier desert crossings By John King CNN Chief National Correspondent On CNN's "State of the Union," CNN host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. King recently traveled to Arizona, to explore the debate over how to control illegal immigration. A fence separates the United States from Mexico in the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Sector in San Luis, Arizona. SAN LUIS, Arizona CNN -- The Yuma desert is below: San Luis, Arizona, to one side and San Luis, Mexico, to the other. On this clear day, the Colorado River is glistening, birds playfully circling over what any map defines as the U.S.-Mexico border in this area. But from a helicopter above, the border is a steel barrier that stands out along the riverbank and against the desert sands, and is the dividing line that gets the most attention from those crying to cross illegally and those who believe recent efforts to bolster U.S. border security have been riddled with wrong choices. Just this past week, eight Democrats in Congress wrote President Obama urging him to halt any further construction of the fence, one of the many border- and immigration -related political debates that have carried over from the Bush administration. To the Border Patrol agents stationed in Yuma Sector, there is no debate. To them, the fence is a success story. From a Vietnam War-vintage Huey helicopter, pilot Chad Smith points across the border to Mexico's Highway 2 and then to the barriers that help stop illegal immigrants from making a sprint into southern Arizona. "You can see the triple-layer fencing," Smith tells us as he lowers the helicopter and hovers over what was once a major crossing point for illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. "Steel fence right on the border, the pedestrian fence about 90 feet north of that, and then the chain-link fence with the barbed wire." 'State of the Union' John King reinvents Sunday talk: More time, for more politics. Sunday, 9 a.m. ET see full schedule » The fence has three layers in areas where there is an urban neighborhood on the Mexican side. Smith is among those who say their flights are less hectic now because while you can still clearly see the trails in the sand and in some hilly areas below, there is considerably less traffic. "I've flown before and come back and had 70-plus [illegal immigrants logged in a tracking book]," Smith said. " I know guys who have gone on a flight and come back with 100-plus illegals in their logbook. Now it is in single digits, typically." It is a fascinating view from above: Old trails in some places, and the remnants of newly placed white sandbags in others. "It forms a pretty good bridge for them to drive across." Smith says of the sandbags. When they are spotted from above, Border Patrol agents on the ground are called in to destroy the makeshift crossings. Congress in 2006 -- with then-Sen. Barack Obama's support -- authorized nearly $3 billion for 670 miles of fencing stretching from California to Texas. There are more lights, sensors and cameras, and there are also more agents like Mike Lowrie driving patrols and chasing tips called in from colleagues monitoring the camera feeds at the Yuma Sector headquarters. Standing alongside the steel barrier at a point in which there is just one layer of fencing, Lowrie shakes his head when told that some in Washington want to stop additional construction in other areas. Don't Miss Recession comes late but hits hard in Peoria "This used to be a very high-trafficked area, and now it is not," Lowrie told us. Asked to define "high traffic," Lowrie says, "In the Yuma Sector, we would get about 800 a day. Now, 25 maybe, or 10." Nodding toward the barrier, he continued: "Numbers don't lie. We didn't have it three years ago, and we were getting massive numbers of illegal entries. We have it now, and we don't." But there are voices on both extremes of the immigration debate that say the role of the fence is exaggerated, or that say the barrier's benefit in slowing illegal traffic is offset by other costs. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose tough stance against illegal immigrants has earned him global media coverage, says the fence is fine, but: "We just arrested 150 in the past 14 days. They're still coming." And Father John Herman, a Roman Catholic priest whose Spanish language Masses are packed with illegal immigrants, blames the fence for more risky crossings in less-populated desert areas. "We know that the way enforcement has gone has driven many people into the desert and caused more deaths. Needless deaths. If we could only get together and work for comprehensive immigration reform."</text>

<title>Opinion: Border security push is a joke - CNN.com</title>
<text>Border security push is a joke By Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor updated 7:38 AM EDT, Fri June 21, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette: Tightened border security won't prevent immigration He says Washington's moves reveal ignorance about 1,969 mile U.S.-Mexico border If people are intent on getting across, they'll find a way, he says Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette . San Diego, California CNN -- When the discussion turns to the U.S.-Mexico border, living less than an hour away has its privileges. I've covered the international boundary from three states California, Arizona and Texas and from every conceivable angle -- including from the air. I once went up in a Border Patrol helicopter that started at the Pacific Ocean and flew east over the fence line. On the Mexican side, homeowners in Tijuana were using the scrap metal wall put up by U.S. taxpayers as their backyard fence. Down the road, groups of young men waited patiently for their chance to cross. What Americans consider an impenetrable barrier, the desperate and determined see as a speed bump on the road to a better life. Ruben Navarrette Jr. I've learned over a quarter-century of writing about immigration from the Southwest to be skeptical about claims that the federal government can fully secure the 1,969-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Don't tell that to Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota. The Republican senators have proposed an amendment to the Senate's "Gang of Eight" immigration bill. It would increase the size of the Border Patrol by 20,000 agents, and complete 700 miles of border fencing. The amendment might get the bill some Republican votes. But it probably won't do much to secure the border. The property line between the two countries goes through everything from deserts to mountains to private ranch land to a university to the Rio Grande. Ever try to build a fence on a river It's not easy. Americans can build walls and fences, triple the number of Border Patrol agents, and deploy SEAL Team 6 if they like. Yet, it won't make much difference. Talk to the experts -- the Border Patrol agents -- and they'll tell you: There is no impediment that a person won't go around, over or under if it means being able to feed his family. Speaking of "under," law enforcement officials say there are likely hundreds of sophisticated drug tunnels all along the U.S.-Mexico border built by drug cartels. The smugglers who used to move illegal drugs have now branched out and smuggle illegal immigrants. There is evidence that they're moving their human cargo through the tunnels -- underneath all the nifty and expensive enforcement tools deployed on the surface. Advocates of border security disagree that the crackdown isn't working. They insist that the fact that the flow of Mexican immigrants into the United States is at a historic low is attributable to the billions of dollars we've spent on everything from border fencing and additional Border Patrol agents to high-tech surveillance equipment. That shows how little they know. There are two major reasons that fewer people are coming, and neither of them originated on the U.S. side of the border. First, there are more opportunities than there have been in recent years to make a decent living in Mexico. And there is a sluggish economy in the United States. So all things being equal, more Mexicans are deciding that migrating to "el norte" isn't worth the hassle. Second, our border crackdowns have been very beneficial to at least one group -- coyote smugglers. Every time we build a mile of fencing or deploy more agents, we make it harder for them to do business, so they raise their prices. A trip across the border that, 10 years ago, cost about $500 now runs as much as $4,000 -- more if you absolutely, positively have to be there overnight. Many Mexicans have sticker shock. Honestly, it makes you wonder if Republicans in Congress are in cahoots with the immigrant smugglers. One is putting money into the pocket of the other. If you want to know why the United States has had such a tough time controlling illegal immigration over the years, there's one reason. What other law enforcement operation can you think of where the harder you crack down, the wealthier and more powerful the bad guys get so they can come back and fight you even harder the next time Here's the elephant in the Congressional caucus room: Americans will never control illegal immigrants until lawmakers -- in both parties -- "man up" and risk angering the businesses that contribute to political campaigns by fining and locking up U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants. And let's not forget one of the biggest offenders, who is somehow never mentioned by the media -- the American household, with its growing dependence on nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, senior care givers and other helpers. Adding to the problem, pro-border security conservatives confuse "securing" the border with "sealing" the border. They say they want to secure the border. But when you hear the details -- i.e., the "100% awareness" rate and "90% apprehension" rate called for by an amendment from Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is almost certainly going to vote against the Senate bill anyway -- it's clear that what these folks really want is to seal the border. There is a big difference between securing and sealing. The former is feasible; the second is a fantasy. Anyway, I suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the Republican senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse. Conservatives saying that we can't have immigration reform before we secure the U.S.-Mexico border is like liberals saying we can't have more welfare reform until we end poverty. That's never going to happen, and they know it. So we're just playing games. In the meantime, millions of people are stuck in the legal equivalent of suspended animation, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a broken system is being wasted.

<title>Concern over proposed Greek border fence - CNN.com</title>
<text>Concern over proposed Greek border fence By Elinda Labropoulou, For CNN A Greek guard patrols the Greek-Turkey border last month. Greece is building a 12-kilometer wall along the border. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Greece has proposed building a fence along its border with Turkey Humanitarian groups say it will hurt asylum seekers The Greek government says it will help curb illegal immigration RELATED TOPICS Turkey Athens, Greece CNN -- Greece's decision to build a 12-kilometer 7.5-mile fence along its border with Turkey in a bid to curb illegal immigration has caused mixed reactions, with humanitarian agencies saying the fence could prevent asylum seekers from reaching safety. Greek Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis announced the decision, saying "action is necessary" because more than 100,000 people have entered Greece illegally in the past year, and the country "can no longer tolerate such high numbers." The European Union border control agency Frontex has said that in October 2010, an average of 245 people per day crossed into Greece illegally, mostly from the overland crossing with Turkey in northeastern Greece. That's where the proposed fence is to be built. "The fence in question is to act as a preventive measure to curb illegal immigration and will be constructed along the country's only overland border with Turkey," the Public Order Ministry told CNN. The rest of the border between the two countries is a 200-kilometer 124-mile river. Illegal migrants usually cross into Greece on inflatable boats or even on foot in the summer, when the waters are low. The ministry has described the 12-kilometer area for the proposed fence as "a series of country roads with no clear border demarcations." The Communist Party of Greece has criticised the measure as "barbaric," and humanitarian agencies have expressed concern that the fence could prevent asylum seekers and others in need from reaching safety. Kalliopi Stefanaki, the UNHCR protection officer for Greece, has described the fence as a "strong measure" but said every country has the right to guard its own borders. "We agree that Greece in entitled to enhance security at its borders in any way it sees fit," she said. "What we are concerned about is that the rights of those who want to cross this, or any other border, to request protection are protected." The UNHCR has repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey to update their asylum systems. "We believe there is a lot of room for improvement on this issue," said Stefanaki. "Greece is not meeting international standards regarding its asylum system." Commenting on the fence proposal, the European Commission said it would be a "short-term measure" that does not address the heart of the problem. The EU has instead asked for structural measures to discourage traffickers and smugglers. Official figures show that currently about 90% of migrants who illegally enter the European Union do so through Greece. "The idea of building more walls around a Fortress Europe is outdated," said Daniel Esdras, the head of the Greek office for the International Organization for Migration. He also called for more international cooperation in addressing the issue. "These are not just Greece's borders, but also those of the European Union," Esdras said. "And people will carry on trying to reach a better life unless conditions in their home countries are improved. This is something governments should together be focusing on." A timeline for the creation of the fence has not been given. The Public Order Ministry says the proposal is still at an initial stage. Share this on:</text>

<sentence cont=0 >Greek Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis announced the decision, saying "action is necessary" because more than 100,000 people have entered Greece illegally in the past year, and the country "can no longer tolerate such high numbers." The European Union border control agency Frontex has said that in October 2010, an average of 245 people per day crossed into Greece illegally, mostly from the overland crossing with Turkey in northeastern Greece.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >That's where the proposed fence is to be built.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The fence in question is to act as a preventive measure to curb illegal immigration and will be constructed along the country's only overland border with Turkey," the Public Order Ministry told CNN.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The rest of the border between the two countries is a 200-kilometer 124-mile river.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Illegal migrants usually cross into Greece on inflatable boats or even on foot in the summer, when the waters are low.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The ministry has described the 12-kilometer area for the proposed fence as "a series of country roads with no clear border demarcations." The Communist Party of Greece has criticised the measure as "barbaric," and humanitarian agencies have expressed concern that the fence could prevent asylum seekers and others in need from reaching safety.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Kalliopi Stefanaki, the UNHCR protection officer for Greece, has described the fence as a "strong measure" but said every country has the right to guard its own borders.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We agree that Greece in entitled to enhance security at its borders in any way it sees fit," she said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"What we are concerned about is that the rights of those who want to cross this, or any other border, to request protection are protected." The UNHCR has repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey to update their asylum systems.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We believe there is a lot of room for improvement on this issue," said Stefanaki.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Greece is not meeting international standards regarding its asylum system." Commenting on the fence proposal, the European Commission said it would be a "short-term measure" that does not address the heart of the problem.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The EU has instead asked for structural measures to discourage traffickers and smugglers.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Official figures show that currently about 90% of migrants who illegally enter the European Union do so through Greece.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The idea of building more walls around a Fortress Europe is outdated," said Daniel Esdras, the head of the Greek office for the International Organization for Migration.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >He also called for more international cooperation in addressing the issue.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"These are not just Greece's borders, but also those of the European Union," Esdras said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"And people will carry on trying to reach a better life unless conditions in their home countries are improved.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >This is something governments should together be focusing on." A timeline for the creation of the fence has not been given.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Public Order Ministry says the proposal is still at an initial stage.</sentence>

<title>Fence that fell brought Arabs together -- briefly - CNN.com</title>
<text>Gazans find Egypt's border door shutting I don't know if they ever made it to Cairo, since Egyptian security forces weren't letting Gazans go beyond the town of Al-'Arish, 40 kilometers west of Rafah. For them, borders are an obstacle. Most people I spoke with were thrilled with the open borders. "We need food and fuel and medicine, everything," one man told me. "And the Egyptians need our business. This is how this should be. We need them; they need us." "We are one people in two countries," another told me. "We should be one country." Not everyone was pondering lofty ideals. "I need to get to Cairo," a Gazan who had an American passport told me. "I haven't had a beer in five years." Egyptians -- identifiable by their unique accents -- mixed easily with the hard-bitten, toughened Gazans, one and all caught up in a frenzy of buying and selling, at the same time reveling in the revolution. Of course, there were moments of tension -- for example when the Egyptian border guards temporarily stopped Gazans from entering Egypt. Rocks were thrown in both directions, curses hurled with equal gusto. But when the Egyptians relented and stepped aside again, it was all handshakes and hardy greetings, shouts of thanks to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for allowing the border to stay open. We even saw roses being passed to the Egyptian border guards. There are so many dimensions to what happened on the border that it's hard to list them all. The Gazan "breakout" has been good for Hamas, which controls this narrow, poverty-stricken strip of land. It's won praise from Palestinians across the political spectrum. Pro-western Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had publicly appealed to Israel to ease the blockade of Gaza, only to have those appeals bruskly brushed aside. Many Gazans we spoke to believe Hamas also took advantage of the open border to bring in weapons, although Hamas strenuously denies that. The collapse of the border -- if only for a few days -- also calls into question Israel's efforts to squeeze Hamas, which was based on the belief that restricting the flow of fuel and goods to Gaza would create public pressure on Hamas to stop rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. And it's a reminder to Washington that its drive for a Middle East peace deal is all the more difficult without Hamas. Last year the United States backed Abbas and his security forces, only to see them swiftly defeated by Hamas in Gaza. Washington tacitly backed the Israeli blockade on Gaza, and now that has collapsed. The tentative hopes raised by the Annapolis Mideast summit last November and by President Bush's visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, during which he reiterated his determination to work out a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, risk being overtaken by events. Events in Gaza also put President Mubarak of Egypt in a quandary. On the one hand, the United States -- the source of more than $2 billion in economic and military aid -- and Israel wanted a swift closure of the border. On the other, many Egyptians, including the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, were agitating with ever greater voice that Egypt come to the rescue of the people of Gaza. The situation on the border with Egypt won't go on for much longer. Monday morning, we watched as Egyptian troops unrolled loops of barbed wire in front of the low cement wall that marks the Egyptian side of No Man's Land. Gradually the situation is coming under control. But a precedent has been set. For a few days at least, the man-made frontier separating Egypt and Gaza disappeared and what took its place seemed natural to people on both sides. But the brief fall of the Gaza border may cause a shudder along other frontiers that divide Arab from Arab. E-mail to a friend</text>

<title>Hundreds of Syrian refugees cross into Turkey - CNN.com</title>
<text>Hundreds of Syrian refugees cross into Turkey From Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert, CNN Hundreds flee Syria Syrian refugees fleeing violence sit on the border with Turkey Refugees from Jisr Al-Shugur says tens of thousands have fled More than 400 Syrian refugees crossed in the past day into Turkey, news agency says Guvecci, Turkey CNN -- About 100 Syrian refugees clustered Wednesday, chanting and holding a Syrian flag, next to a border fence with Turkey, watched closely by several Turkish soldiers pacing in front of them. During the course of the day, more than 400 others crossed into Turkish territory near the village of Karbeyaz, even though this is not an official border gate, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said. They were housed in a tent city near Yayladagi, along the border, where nearly 700 people were sheltered in 100 tents, the agency said. Many of the refugees are from the Syrian border town of Jisr Al-Shugur, from which they say tens of thousands of residents have fled over the past week after scores of people were killed in fighting. Syrian refugees flee into Turkey Residents fear military wrath in Syria Clashes increase along Syrian border RELATED TOPICS Protests and Demonstrations The Syrian government said more than 80 security forces were killed in an ambush by "armed groups" in Jisr Al-Shugur. But residents of the town say those people died after fighting broke out among Syrian soldiers, some of whom mutinied after Syrian troops fired on anti-government demonstrators at the funeral of a slain protester. "My friend was shot next to me when we were at a funeral for a martyr," said one Syrian refugee, speaking by telephone to CNN from a stand of trees on the Syrian side of the hilly border area. "There is no milk for children, no water" in Jisr Al-Shugur, he said. "They poisoned the water and there is no more bread." The refugee, who asked not to be identified, said he did not plan to flee into Turkey unless Syrian troops threatened him and his family at this makeshift frontier haven. Activist Fadi Mustafa Soufi, speaking via Skype with CNN from the cluster of refugees along the frontier, said shortly after noon that two women wounded in fighting in Jisr Al-Shugur had arrived in a vehicle. "One woman was shot in the face, but she's not dead yet," Soufi said. Several dozen soldiers who had defected and changed into civilian clothes were among the refugees, Soufi said. On Tuesday night, a refugee woman named Um Ahmed told CNN she had fled to the border with her daughters to escape what she expected would be a Syrian government attack on Jisr Al-Shugur. A growing number of Syrian refugees have fled to Turkey over the past month and a half, raising the possibility of a refugee exodus. In late April, about 250 Syrian civilians fled across the border to the Turkish village of Guvecci. There, they have been housed in tents and fed by the Turkish Red Crescent at an old tobacco factory. Turkish authorities have denied journalists permission to speak with the refugees and have refused to allow the refugees to leave the compound. Turkish officials speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that 41 Syrians -- several of them wounded -- crossed the border Saturday. A doctor, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that more than 30 Syrians with gunshot and shrapnel wounds had been treated at a hospital in Turkey in recent days. Meanwhile, Soufi, the activist from Jisr Al-Shugur, said he saw the bodies of two wounded Syrian men who died while being driven to the Turkish border. In the past, the Turkish government has made a show of evacuating wounded civilians from Iraq and Libya. But Ankara has taken a different approach with dozens of wounded civilians fleeing Syria. Turkey fears a repeat of the 1991 exodus of large numbers of Kurdish refugees from Northern Iraq. Ankara has also spent the past decade promoting cozy relations and lucrative economic ties with Syria's 45-year-old president, Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations reports more than 1,000 people have been killed during anti-regime protests in Syria in less than three months. Over the past month, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has begun calling for reform in Damascus in a bid to curb the escalating violence. "It is out of the question that we close the border at this point. The developments in Syria are saddening. We are watching in worry," Erdogan said Wednesday. "We hope that Syria changes its attitude towards the civilians to a more tolerant one and realizes its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians." Erdogan has been furiously campaigning ahead of Turkish parliamentary elections scheduled to take place on June 12. Journalist Rasha Qass Yousef contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

<title>'Bargain' aims to deal with border, then guest workers - CNN.com</title>
<text>'Bargain' aims to deal with border, then guest workers Story Highlights • GOP senator calls agreement reached between parties a "grand bargain" • Border security, citizenship, guest workers will be crux of next week's debate • Bipartisan group working to hammer out differences in last year's failed legislation • House speaker says she wants strong GOP support guaranteed before any vote Adjust font size: WASHINGTON CNN -- Senators may have mended fences on contentious immigration legislation that sputtered in Congress last year, and they will head into next week's debate with what one GOP senator called a "grand bargain." However, it's unclear if lawmakers will pick up where they left off, or if they plan to start anew. Senators from both parties have hammered out an outline for a bill and "have come to an agreement on what we have called a, quote, 'grand bargain,' " Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pennsylvania, said from the Senate floor Tuesday. Speaking at a Wednesday news conference, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, urged President Bush to join the bipartisan group of senators in ushering a bill through the legislative process. "The president has got to be personally involved," Leahy said. "You cannot just send up Cabinet members and ask them to speak with a few members of the president's party and think that's going to get you through. You cannot issue great-sounding press releases on a take-it-or-leave-it basis." Leahy said he believes the president is committed to solving the nation's immigration woes, "but this won't work unless he comes in and talks to both Republicans and Democrats and makes it very clear that he is behind our efforts." Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has set a Monday deadline for beginning debate on the issue, but he has not indicated whether senators would discuss the old bill or a new one. "One of those two things I will bring to the Senate floor, and that will be the working document that we will work from," Reid said Tuesday. Bush and Democratic leaders have generally concurred on immigration, much to the chagrin of Bush's conservative base, which helped shoot down last year's legislation in the GOP-controlled Congress. Last year's bill stalled because of its reliance on Bush's proposed temporary guest-worker program and a clause paving a road to citizenship for the millions of immigrants already in the United States illegally. GOP critics in the House of Representatives fiercely opposed the proposals, saying they amounted to "amnesty." The Senate bill never meshed with a GOP-skippered House proposal that focused primarily on border enforcement, and the prospect of an immigration overhaul ultimately died. Congressional sources said earlier this month that a bipartisan group of legislators was working to reconcile the proposals, and it hasn't come easy. Full story Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-authored the plan that stalled last year, said as much this month. Added GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia: "All of the meetings I've been in are very intense because this is the No. 1 domestic issue in the country and passions run deeply on all sides." Weeks of negotiations have focused on a compromise that would OK citizenship and a guest-worker program only after the White House showed progress in securing the nation's borders and enforcing already-existing immigration laws, sources said. "We are talking about triggers," Specter said, "so that we don't move ahead to dealing with the 11 million undocumented immigrants or dealing with a temporary-worker program until we have solved the problem of securing the border and providing for identification so that there is a basis for using tough sanctions on the employers." To enforce such sanctions, Specter said, you have to give employers "a fair opportunity to know who is legal and who is illegal." The measure under consideration would double the number of Border Patrol agents to 12,000 and would include "very strong employer sanctions," Specter said. While Democrats and Republicans seem to be reaching an agreement in the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said she wants to see strong GOP support for an immigration bill before it hits the House hopper. She reportedly has told the White House that no immigration bill will make it to the House floor unless Bush can guarantee at least 70 Republican ayes. The ultimatum is aimed at ensuring the bill is labeled bipartisan, thereby making it difficult for Republicans to use the legislation against Democrats in the 2008 elections, a Democratic source said. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report. Tools:</text>

<title>CNN.com - Bush pushes immigration plan on border visit - May 18, 2006</title>
<text>Bush pushes immigration plan on border visit U.S. President George W. Bush tours the US-Mexico border at San Luis, Arizona, Thursday. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Manage Alerts | What Is This WASHINGTON CNN -- President George W. Bush visited the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday to try to build support for his plan to stem the tide of illegal immigrants into the United States. In an interview with CNN White House Correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, Bush was asked how he can convince his opponents -- including many in his own Republican party -- that his plan is sound. "I can offer them a comprehensive strategy to get the job done," Bush said in San Luis, Arizona, a town across the border from the Mexican community of San Luis Rio Colorado. Watch Bush explain his plan -- 6:15 Asked about skepticism and criticism by some that Bush is using the border issue as a publicity stunt, the president told CNN, "To secure this border is going to require a comprehensive approach. Comprehensive means more agents, more technology and a temporary worker program." Bush is seeking $1.9 billion from Congress, for, among other things, the deployment of up to 6,000 National Guard troops to help Border Patrol agents. The number of troops will increase gradually to that number by 2008, Bush said, and will be reduced as the Border Patrol is able to increase its presence. "They will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, building infrastructure, analyzing intelligence, and providing training until new Border Patrol officers and technologies come online," Bush wrote in a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Watch whether border technology actually works -- 2:04 "The request for additional resources, coupled with additional legal authority from the Congress, will end the practice of catch and release along our southern border once and for all by increasing detention, transportation, and removal capabilities," Bush said. The troops would have no law enforcement role, but their presence would free Border Patrol agents from logistical duties and speed construction projects along the border, Bush said. The National Guard troops will come from units in potentially every state, and will be under the command of the governors of the four southern border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Bush has promised the governors -- who can veto the use of their troops -- the federal government would repay them for their costs. During Bush's visits with border agents and other officials Thursday in Yuma, Arizona, he did not discuss either of two competing proposals in Congress -- one approved by the House that would build 700 miles of fence and one in the Senate that would build half that. Bush said this isn't the first time his administration has addressed the border issue. He said that since he took office in 2001, the number of border agents has increased from 9,000 to nearly 12,000. More than 100 agents have been added in the busy Yuma sector in the past year, for a total of 660, he said. New fencing, lighting and cameras have been added in key locations. "We're in the process of making the border the most technologically advanced in the world," Bush said. Opponents contend the barriers would shift illegal immigrant and smuggling traffic to areas of the border without fencing. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants come from Mexico, and most are sent home within 24 hours, he said. The president's guest-worker program would allow foreign workers to fill jobs in the United States for a limited time, after which they would return home. Immigrants with roots in the United States would be given a process to follow to gain citizenship, if they qualified. Bush stressed that opponents of his plan should not be considered racists. "I think it would be too harsh a judgment to say that somebody who doesn't support a comprehensive immigration plan is a racist," he said. Support growing Public support for President Bush's handling of immigration issues has improved, according to a CNN poll released Thursday. Thirty-six percent of respondents approved of his handling of immigration, up from 25 percent in a poll taken in January. By a 2-to-1 margin, those polled said they favored Bush's plan to deploy National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border. And by an even larger margin -- 79 percent to 18 percent -- they said they favored allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for citizenship. However, respondents in the poll were more evenly split when it came to Bush's temporary worker program. Asked if they favored a program that would allow temporary workers to come to the United States without leading to citizenship, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent opposed, which was within the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Sixty-two percent said immigration would be extremely or very important to their vote for Congress this year. But generally speaking, immigration remains low on the public's list of priorities. The economy, terrorism, the war in Iraq, public corruption and fuel prices rank higher. Fewer than half of those polled approved of Bush's handling of any of those subjects, and 57 percent said they disapproved of his performance in office. The president's overall approval rating stands at 36 percent, a slight improvement from the previous mark of 34 percent in a poll taken earlier this month. The poll, conducted for CNN by Opinion Research Corporation, surveyed 1,022 adults Tuesday and Wednesday. Story Tools</text>

<title>Opinion: What Obama could learn on the border - CNN.com</title>
<text>What Obama could learn on the border By Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor updated 2:28 PM EDT, Thu July 10, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette: President Obama should visit the border in light of crisis He says Obama's call for more spending is right, but won't stop flow of people seeking refuge Republicans will have to accept more spending on border and immigration, he says Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. San Diego, California CNN -- It's the law of unintended consequences. Each time Americans spend billions to fortify the border by building fences or hiring Border Patrol agents, human traffickers raise their prices. Today, it costs about $3,000 to move a person across the border. It's less if you brave mountain lions and cross off the beaten path. It's more if you cross near civilization and absolutely positively have to be there overnight. If we bolster enforcement, the price could soar to $6,000. Ruben Navarrette Jr. How do we win a battle against an opponent when, the more we spend to defeat him, the more we empower him to fight back This riddle could stump anyone, but President Barack Obama seems to find it especially difficult. Raised in Hawaii and having lived in Chicago, Obama is a newbie to the border. He's made one memorable visit in 5½ as president and he must have felt as if he landed on another planet. Border Democrat on immigration crisis Even on this week's fundraising swing through Texas, Obama couldn't find time to visit the border. That was his loss. When you travel from San Diego to Douglas, Arizona, to Columbus, New Mexico, to Brownsville, Texas, it's like you're visiting several worlds at once. Each stretch has its own script. It's a fascinating area -- unless you're not interested. Obama doesn't seem all that interested in the border, except when he can use it as a weapon. In May 2011, during a visit to El Paso, Texas, Obama mocked Republicans by saying they wanted to build a moat on the border and fill it with alligators. View my Flipboard Magazine. This week, in Dallas, more than 500 miles from the border, the president revealed his plans for tens of thousands of kids whose heads are filled with nightmares. Since October, spurred by violent youth gangs in their home countries and fake news reports of "permisos" for young people approved by Congress, about 52,000 children and teenagers from Central America have been apprehended on the border. "Apprehended" is too generous a word, since most of these people reportedly went up to Border Patrol agents with their arms raised and asked to be arrested. These uninvited guests are neither invading nor evading. They're surrendering. A lot of Texas Democrats probably thought it was a bad idea for Obama to snub the border, and one said so out loud. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, suggested that Obama's failure to survey firsthand the scene of the crisis evoked memories of President George W. Bush viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina from an airplane flying high overhead. This week, Cuellar said: "I hope this doesn't become the Katrina moment for President Obama, saying that he doesn't need to come to the border. He should come down." Now that U.S. officials have custody of the border kids, many of whom were -- according to media reports -- sexually assaulted or had their lives threatened, the hard part is deciding what to do with them. Do we really want to send them back Are we that monstrous Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to deal with the crisis -- which includes $1.8 billion to help the Department of Health and Human Services provide better care for the children, and another $1.6 billion to help the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice expedite their removal. The remaining $300 million would go to the State Department to help Latin American governments counter the misinformation campaign. This budgetary whiplash -- where we show these kids some kindness before banishing them to the dark, desperate and dangerous places from which they escaped -- summarizes Obama's muddled approach to the immigration issue, where he tries to be both tough and compassionate and winds up confused. We need more border funding, but we could also use a lot more honestly and clarity in this debate. Money can't buy that. Liberals will have to swallow the fact that it was their foil, George W. Bush, who signed a law in 2008 giving safe haven to unaccompanied minors from Central America, and now it's their champion, Barack Obama, who seeks the power to override it. Meanwhile, conservatives are putting up a fight against the funding, but that won't last. They can't stand the idea of letting these kids stay here and grow up to become dependents and Democrats, and so they have to help Obama fund their return. For a while, there will be a tug-of-war in the GOP between the border hawks and budget hawks. But the former will win. That's a good outcome. It would also be good for Congress to pass immigration reform, and for Obama to ease up on deportations. For now, the administration needs the $3.7 billion, and it should get every penny. Congress should be generous, and the President should be diligent, but neither of them should be naive. On the border, enforcement dollars are no silver bullet. We can hire more Border Patrol agents, build more walls, and expedite deportations. But none of that will stop the downtrodden, desperate, and determined from seeking refuge in a country that is supposed to be in the business of offering it. And if Obama spent more time on the border, he'd already know that.</text>

<title>Civil unions become law in Delaware - CNN.com</title>
<text>Civil unions become law in Delaware By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gov. Jack Markell signed the bill Wednesday night Delaware lawmakers passed the measure in April It will take effect January 1 CNN -- Calling it "a moment in our history," Delaware Gov. Jack Markell has signed a bill legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples in the state. The bill, which was passed by state lawmakers in April, will take effect January 1. "This bill is about a new energy and excitement," Markell said at the bill signing ceremony Wednesday night. "It's about a moment in our history that came about because people came together to work for it, because it became clear that Delaware's LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is in fact part of every Delaware community. The greater good is served when we speak out and fight hard when we see that bias, prejudice or even outdated laws attempt to lessen any one of us." The measure does not allow same-sex couples to obtain marriage licenses, and religious institutions retain the right to refuse to solemnize such unions. Also under the bill, Delaware will recognize legal relationships that same-sex couples enter into in another jurisdiction, whether that is a civil union or a marriage, and treat the relationship as a civil union, according to Markell's office. Gay-rights groups lauded the new law. "Tonight is a wonderful night for LGBT equality in Delaware," said Lisa Goodman, president of Equality Delaware and the host of the bill-signing celebration, according to the statement issued by Markell's office. "The governor's signature on this legislation moves same-sex couples in Delaware closer to equality," said Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "... It is not a substitute for full legal marriage, but it provides fundamental security for same-sex couples that will allow them to take care of each other and their families. This is reason to celebrate." Rep. Melanie George, the bill's sponsor in the Delaware House of Representatives, said she believes "with every fiber of my being that this is the right thing to do." "Tonight, we say to loving and committed couples across the state who want the law to endorse the promise they made long ago in their hearts: 'Your love is equally valid and deserving. Your family is now equal under the law,'" Markell said. The law makes Delaware the eighth state to offer civil unions or comprehensive domestic partnerships for same-sex couples, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The others are California, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington. Couples in Illinois can begin applying for civil union licenses on June 1, according to the organization, and Hawaii's law takes effect January 1. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.

<title>Priests in same-sex relationships may become Anglican Bishops - CNN.com</title>
<text>Priests in same-sex relationships may become Anglican Bishops By Ben Brumfield, CNN updated 11:50 AM EST, Sat January 5, 2013 The Church of England announced that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The priests in same-sex unions must remain celibate The Anglican Church recognizes marriage as being only between a man and a woman Sex should be practiced only within a marriage, the church says Women may be priests but are not allowed to become bishops CNN -- Men in a civil union will now be allowed to become bishops in the Church of England, but they are not allowed to have sex. Intercourse between two men -- or two women -- remains a sin. "Homosexual genital acts fall short of the Christian ideal and are to be met with a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion," according to Anglican doctrine. Men and women in same-sex unions were already allowed to serve as priests in the Church of England, but there was a moratorium on advancement to the episcopate -- becoming a bishop -- while the church considered the issue. The church announced Friday that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops, as long as they are "living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality." Any priest looking to become a bishop must undergo a thorough examination of "personal and family circumstances," according to a statement released by the House of Bishops of the Church of England. Female priests are barred from advancing to the position of bishop, as a vote on the measure in the church failed to pass lay approval last November despite an overwhelming majority of support within the church hierarchy. Women have been permitted to enter the priesthood since the early 1990s. The church defines marriage "as a faithful, committed, permanent and legally sanctioned relationship between a man and a woman, is central to the stability and health of human society." It believes sex should be practiced exclusively within a marriage. The British parliament is expected to consider legislation allowing same-sex marriage, but the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be prohibited from performing wedding ceremonies as long as it remains against canon law. In 2005, Britain allowed same-sex couples to register civil partnerships, prompting the church to consider the issue. It does not bless civil unions of any kind, for fear some of them may be sexual. But it also does not exclude gays and lesbians from the flock, according to it 2005 deliberations. The Anglican Church is a protestant denomination intimately associated with the American Episcopal Church. The church and state in Britain are formally connected. The two archbishops of the church, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, along with 24 other bishops, have seats in Parliament in the House of Lords. Though women may not yet rise to high positions in its clergy, Queen Elizabeth is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.</text>

<title>Rhode Island legislature passes civil union bill - CNN.com</title>
<text>Rhode Island legislature passes civil union bill By David Ariosto, CNN NEW: Senate passes bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples NEW: If signed by Gov. Lincoln Chafee, the law would take effect on July 1 Civil unions are currently permitted in New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware and Hawaii CNN -- Less than a week after New York became the nation's sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, Rhode Island state lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favor of a bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples. The measure, which passed the state Senate by a count of 21-16, is widely seen as a compromise intended to provide same-sex couples with added rights and benefits, while also preventing an expanded legal definition of marriage. Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, is expected to sign the bill into law, according to his spokesman, Michael Trainor. If signed, the law would take effect on July 1, making Rhode Island the fifth state in the union to allow civil unions between same-sex couples. Such unions are currently permitted in New Jersey and Illinois, and will be allowed in Delaware and Hawaii beginning January 1, 2012. Three West Coast states -- California, Oregon and Washington -- plus Nevada, also allow for "comprehensive domestic partnerships," largely considered an equivalent to their civil union counterparts. Despite robust opposition to the measure, Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill by a vote of 7-4, sending it to the Democrat-controlled Senate floor where lawmakers voted in its favor, according to Senate spokesman, Greg Pare. Rhode Island passes civil union bill RELATED TOPICS Relationships The legislation, which passed overwhelmingly in the state's lower house on May 19, affords same-sex couples a host of new state tax breaks, health-care benefits and greater ease of inheritance. But it also drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and opposition groups who say it will lead to court-ordered action that would eventually legalize same-sex marriage. Similar legal action in Connecticut and Massachusetts resulted in those states adopting same-sex marriage laws, noted Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage's Rhode Island chapter. Chafee -- who is supportive of potential legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage -- says civil unions are "a step in the right direction," according to Trainor. Meanwhile, gay rights activists -- like Marriage Equality Rhode Island -- say that while they support the civil union bill, they would prefer legislation that permits same-sex couples to wed. The group urged Chafee not to sign the measure if it includes a House amendment that permits groups with religious affiliations to refuse certain legal rights provided to civil unions. For instance, a hospital with a religious affiliation could refuse a civil union partner from being involved in the emergency medical care decisions of their spouse if it chose to do so, said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the activist group. Chafee is "very aware of the concerns that have been expressed," Trainor said, but will likely sign the bill into law, which passed the Senate with the controversial amendment included. House spokesman Larry Berman called the issue a "red herring," pursued by the state's more radical activists. The exemption, he said, is meant to provide religious protections against potential litigation. "It's a small exception," Berman said, when compared to the slew of new rights and benefits same-sex couples would enjoy should the measure be signed into law. Currently, Rhode Island and Maine are the only states in New England that do not permit same-sex marriage. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in states that permit such unions. The measure will take effect on July 24, providing gay and lesbian couples with new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. Federal recognition, however, was not a part of Friday's vote, leaving benefits like Social Security and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same-sex couples. The controversial bill passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate before reaching Cuomo's desk, in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote. Iowa and the District of Columbia also allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. Share this on:</text>

<title>Witness: Civil unions like allowing just one bite of Twinkie - CNN.com</title>
<text>California San Francisco, California CNN -- A gay couple challenging Proposition 8 in federal court Monday said civil unions and domestic partnerships aren't the same as marriages, something they view as a stepping stone toward starting a family. "[It's] like putting a Twinkie at the end of a treadmill and saying, 'You can only have a bite,' " testified Paul Katami, one of the plaintiffs. "And you want the whole thing. ... All I want is to be married." Katami and his partner, Jeffrey Zarrillo, are among plaintiffs asking Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to issue an injunction against the enforcement of California's Proposition 8, arguing the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. If allowed to marry his partner, 36-year-old Zarrillo said he would finally feel equal and complete. "I'd be able to stand there as one family, as a married individual," Zarrillo said, noting the "pride that one feels when that happens." During testimony, attorney David Boies asked Zarrillo why he believed marriage was a better option for same-sex couples when compared with domestic partnerships and other arrangements states have for same-sex couples. "Domestic partnership would relegate me to second-class citizenship, maybe third-class -- and that's not enough," he said. Zarrillo and Katami of Los Angeles, California, are joined by Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier of Berkeley, California, in the court challenge. Zarrillo said he believes it's an important step to be married before having children, saying it would make it easier for the couple and the child and would afford the child additional protections. Being married and wearing a wedding ring sends a message to society, he said. "It says to them, these individuals are serious," Zarrillo said. "They're committed to one another." Another attorney for the couples, Theodore Olson, argued to the judge that a ban on Proposition 8 leaves gay couples out of something available to all other people in the United States. "Marriage is central to life in America," Olson said. "It promotes mental, physical and emotional self. It's the building block of family, neighborhoods and community in our society." Proposition 8, Olson said, ended the dream of marriage for same-sex couples, which includes hundreds of thousands of Californians. The state, he said, "has put people into categories." "You're different, and we're going to take away that right from you," Olson said, interpreting the meaning of the ban. "... That's discrimination." However, Charles Cooper, an attorney representing Protect Marriage, the group that came up with Proposition 8, told the judge in his opening statement the purpose of marriage is to promote procreation between men and women. Same-sex marriage "will likely lead to very real social harm; it's too novel and experimental," he argued. Californians "are entitled to make this critical decision for themselves," he said, pointing to voter support of the proposition. Except for the issue of marriage, gays and lesbians have been successful in attaining policy goals, Cooper said, adding that California has some of the most comprehensive protections in the nation. About 100 protesters against the measure and in favor of same-sex marriage gathered peacefully outside the courthouse before the hearing, waving signs supporting equal rights. The case will likely head to the U.S. Supreme Court no matter the outcome. It is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether Americans can marry people of the same sex. In legal circles and across the Internet, it has been dubbed this generation's Brown v. Board of Education, the case that led to the Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in schools. Some say it could be the biggest ruling since Roe v. Wade, which tackled abortion. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. CNN's Mallory Simon and Bill Mears contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

<title>French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill - CNN.com</title>
<text>French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN updated 11:38 AM EST, Tue February 12, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: France's lower house of parliament approves the bill 329 to 229 The legislation must be passed by the Senate before it can become law The Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups in France are opposed Supporters say same-sex couples should have equal rights to marry and adopt children CNN -- Same-sex marriage in France came one step closer to legality Tuesday, as lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples. The measure was voted through in the National Assembly by 329 in favor to 229 against, with 10 deputies abstaining. The bill must still go before the senate before it becomes law. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage. UK lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same-sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the House of Commons. Open Mic: French on same-sex marriage UK MPs approve legal same-sex marriage Gay bishop takes message on road But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation, which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron, the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron's Conservative Party. The bill must go through several more stages before it can become law. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the UK legislation. In the United States, where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage, it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia -- but many people remain vehemently opposed. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. Opinion: Why the fuss about gay marriage The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month. The left also controls the Senate. But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks. Another big rally against the law is planned for next month. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Same-sex marriage around the world Opening up marriage to same-sex couples "would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone," he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a "deceit" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and many lawmakers and hundreds of mayors are against the legislation. The legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates, however. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT has said the law, if passed, "would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights." Lawmakers have a "unique opportunity" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. "The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity," it said. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS pacte civil de solidarite, the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage. Opinion: Gay rights in France -- How even the U.S. leads the way Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriages. Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed, according to Pew. Nonetheless, 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The issue has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed "support marriage equality." According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws.

<title>Same-sex Marriage - Issues - Election Center 2008 - CNN.com</title>
<text>Primaries LGBT issues From the debate over same-sex marriage to the military's "Don't ask, don't tell policy," issues that affect the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trangender LGBT community look to play a prominent role in this year's presidential election. Read the stances of the presidential candidates below. The views of the vice presidential candidates are shown where available. REPUBLICANS John McCain Believes the institution of marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Voted for the Defense of Marriage Act but voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. Says states and local governments should set their own marriage policies. Voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1996. During an interview in 2000, McCain said: "I think that the present laws that clearly prevent a discrimination of any kind certainly [apply] to gays and homosexuals as well. That's why I voted the way that I did. I think that enforcement of existing law could work rather than passing special laws for special categories of people." When asked about the military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, McCain said: "...I don't think there's any doubt that there are evolving attitudes in America about many issues, including this one, but every military leader that I talk to, I say 'Should we change it' They say, 'It's working.' And right now we've got the best military we've ever had -- the most professional, best trained, equipped and the bravest. And so I think it's logical to leave this issue alone. I really do." The McCain campaign states that gay adoption is a state issue and does not endorse any federal legislation. Sarah Palin Stated on Sarah Palin for Governor Web site: "I believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman." Stated during the vice presidential debate October 2, "No one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties." According to a New York Times report, she supported an amendment to the Alaska state constitution that would have banned same-sex marriage, but, during her tenure as governor, she vetoed a bill that would have denied health benefits to same-sex partners of public employees on grounds that it was unconstitutional. DEMOCRATS Barack Obama Opposes same-sex marriage, but also opposes a constitutional ban. Says he would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. As stated on the Obama campaign Web site, he supports full civil unions that "give same-sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married couples, including the right to assist their loved ones in times of emergency as well as equal health insurance, employment benefits, and property and adoption rights." Says the Employment Non-Discrimination Act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Advocated legislation that sought to expand federal hate crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Says the military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy needs to be repealed. Joe Biden Opposes same-sex marriage. Voted against a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Supports civil unions. Says he believes legal recognition should not be denied to same-sex couples. Advocates re-examining federal laws, including the tax code, to ensure national laws are not unfair to same-sex couples and that committed adults who are adopting are not discriminated against because of sexual orientation. Supports letting states determine how to recognize civil unions and define marriage. Also supports ending the military's "don't ask, don't tell" Policy. Supports adding sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes.</text>

<title>With veto overrides, Vermont legalizes same-sex marriage - CNN.com</title>
<text>Economy enters same-sex marriage debate The Human Rights Campaign, which describes itself as the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, issued a statement applauding the votes, noting Vermont is the first state to legalize same-sex marriage through the legislative process. "This historic vote in the Vermont Legislature reminds us of the incredible progress being made toward equality," said Joe Solmonese, Human Rights Campaign president, in the statement. "Less than five years ago, lesbian and gay couples began marrying in Massachusetts. Now, with the Iowa court decision last Friday and today's vote in Vermont, there will be four states recognizing the right to marry for loving, committed lesbian and gay couples." Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin was quoted in the statement as saying, "The struggle for equal rights is never easy. I was proud to be president of the Senate nine years ago when Vermont created civil unions. Today we have overridden the governor's veto. I have never felt more proud of Vermont as we become the first state in the country to enact marriage equality, not as the result of a court order, but because it is the right thing to do." Vermont's neighboring state, New Hampshire , also has taken steps toward legalizing same-sex marriages. On March 26, the New Hampshire House passed a bill by seven votes that would legalize same-sex marriage, sending it to the Senate, according to the Concord Monitor newspaper. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch has said he opposes same-sex marriage but has not said whether he will veto a bill legalizing it. Like Vermont, New Hampshire allows civil unions for same-sex couples. "The civil unions bill [Lynch] signed into law prevents discrimination and provides the same legal protections to all New Hampshire families to the extent that is possible under federal law," Lynch spokesman Colin Manning told the Monitor. On Friday, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a state law banning same-sex marriage. The decision upheld a 2007 ruling by a lower court that struck down Iowa's 1998 law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. Polk County District Judge Robert Hanson found that the law violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection and hurt gay and lesbian couples "in numerous tangible and intangible" ways.</text>

<title>EPA limits carbon pollution from new power plants - CNN.com</title>
<text>EPA limits carbon pollution from new power plants By Aaron Cooper, CNN updated 12:01 PM EDT, Fri September 20, 2013 Steam rises form the cooling towers of the Burbank Water and Power natural-gas-fueled power plant in Burbank, California. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The standards are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants Existing power plants are exempt from these regulations, but others are coming Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia criticizes what he calls "impossible standards" Washington CNN -- The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new rules aimed at limiting the amount of carbon pollution coming from new power plants. The standards, which would set separate limits for natural gas and coal power plants, are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants. "Power plants are the single largest sources of carbon pollution," EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in remarks prepared for delivery at the National Press Club in Washington. "New power plants can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies. These technologies offer them a clear path forward, today and in the long-term." New coal power plants and small natural gas plants would be limited to 1,100 pounds of C02 emissions per megawatt-hour. Larger natural gas plants would be limited to one thousand pounds a megawatt-hour. These restrictions are slightly looser than a set first proposed in 2012. McCarthy said the new proposal factors in public feedback from public comments received last year. Existing power plants are exempt from the proposed carbon regulation, but McCarthy said regulations on those plants will be proposed in June. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents coal-rich West Virginia, criticized the administration as trying to hold the coal industry to "impossible standards" "Never before has the federal government forced an industry to do something that is technologically impossible. Forcing coal to meet the same emissions standards as gas when experts know that the required technology is not operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense and will have devastating impacts to the coal industry and our economy," he said in a written statement. McCarthy said the EPA has a history of pollution standards driving technological development. "The old rules may say we can't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we've always used new technologies, we've used science, we've used research and development and discovery to make the old rules obsolete," McCarthy said. The president and CEO of the National Mining Association also had harsh words for the proposal. "The regulation announced today by EPA effectively bans coal from America's power portfolio, leaving new power plants equipped with even the most efficient and environmentally advanced technologies out in the cold," said Hal Quinn, asserting that the EPA is "recklessly gambling with the nation's energy and economic future." He said standards should be based on the best technology available today. An EPA official briefing the media on the new clean air proposals Friday said that if they are finalized, the method of recouping costs associated with the new regulations would be determined by the industry. When pressed, the EPA official refused to say if the increased costs would be passed on to consumers. The standards will be open for public comment for 60 days, during which time the agency said, it plans to hold public hearings.</text>

<title>EPA administrator announces resignation - CNN.com</title>
<text>updated 1:13 PM EST, Thu December 27, 2012 EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson listens as President Obama delivers remarks to EPA employees in January. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The EPA head says she will step down after the State of the Union address Lisa Jackson has held the post for four years She says her goal was to focus on climate change while not ignoring other issues CNN -- Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson will step down after the president's January State of the Union speech, the agency said Thursday. Jackson thanked President Barack Obama for having placed her in the post four years ago and said she leaves the EPA "confident the ship is sailing in the right direction." It is not uncommon for agencies to change leadership when new presidential terms begin. Jackson said she is "ready in my own life for new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference." In a statement, she recalled the goal she set at the beginning of her tenure to focus on climate change, but not to ignore other issues such as air pollution, toxic chemicals and waste-site cleanup issues. "The way to transform this country and make it ready for the next 100 years is through new legislation that addresses energy, that deals with climate change, that deals with the issues that people are so scared of," Jackson told CNN at the beginning of her tenure as administrator. The Obama administration's record on the passing tough environmental laws has been mixed. Under Jackson's leadership, the EPA created new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants. It was the first time that U.S. coal- and oil-fired power plant operators were required to limit their emissions of mercury and other hazardous pollutants. Jackson also vigorously defended her agency against a 2010 bill that would have stopped the EPA from regulating carbon emissions. She wrote a column where she accused the bill's backers of siding with "big oil companies and their lobbyists" in an effort to "take away EPA's ability to protect the health and welfare of Americans from greenhouse gas pollution." The bill was defeated in the Senate. "Over the last four years, Lisa Jackson has shown an unwavering commitment to the health of our families and our children," Obama said in a statement. "Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, including implementing the first national standard for harmful mercury pollution, taking important action to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act, and playing a key role in establishing historic fuel economy standards that will save the average American family thousands of dollars at the pump, while also slashing carbon pollution." During this year's presidential campaign, GOP candidate Mitt Romney accused Jackson and two other Obama appointees of pursuing policies that drive up gasoline prices. He called for her firing. There were times when Obama himself became an obstacle to Jackson. In September 2011, Obama ordered Jackson to scrap a plan for reducing ozone pollution. At the time, the president stressed his environmental record, but said the additional regulations would create uncertainty that could slow down the economic recovery. The move was criticized by environmentalists who accused Obama of siding with corporate polluters over the public's health. The EPA had argued that increasing the standard would save 4,300 lives per year, prevent 7,000 hospital visits and avoid 2.6 million missed days of work or school. Amid rumors that Jackson would leave the agency, a grassroots movement emerged online, asking her to remain on the job, which she did. Jackson said that her background as a mother, a graduate from Princeton and Tulane universities and resident of New Orlean's 9th Ward allows her to tackle the issues facing the environment. She was the first African-American to head up the EPA, a distinction she gave weight to as she undertook her work. "I don't think of it every moment," she told CNN as she entered the job. "But what I hope that we see at the end of this are activists who look like me -- activists who represent the future demographic of our country, because that's who's going to be the EPA in the future."</text>

<title>Western Australia kills its first shark as part of cull - CNN.com</title>
<text>Shark culling begins in Western Australia, angering conservationists By Peter Shadbolt, CNN updated 10:38 AM EST, Mon January 27, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Western Australian government kills first shark as part of a controversial culling program Shooting of a three-meter tiger shark draws an angry response from activists Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in WA over the past three years The state's premier Colin Barnett defended the bait-and-kill policy, saying it put people first CNN -- The Western Australian government killed its first shark over the weekend as part of a controversial culling program that has drawn an angry reaction from conservationists and activists. A spokesman for the Western Australia WA government confirmed that a commercial fisherman had caught and shot a three-meter tiger shark one kilometer off Old Dunsborough in the South West region. The government's program of using hooked lines attached to floating drums to cull sharks in its waters follows a spate of fatal shark attacks in the waters off Australia's largest state. Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in WA over the past three years, the government said. The scheme has been denounced by conservationists who say the sea predators should remain protected species. The culling program went ahead after federal environment minister Greg Hunt granted WA an exemption under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act allowing the state to hunt down sharks. The exemption allows it to hunt the protect great white shark, one of the world's largest marine predators. Aussie freaks out by 10-foot visitor Shark, dolphin or is this even real "To think this shark had been in the water for 12 hours, possibly with a big bleeding hook in its mouth suffering, is just ridiculous," Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Rae Threnoworth told CNN affiliate Sky News. The state's premier Colin Barnett, however, said the bait-and-kill policy puts people first. "I get no pleasure from seeing sharks killed, but I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia, and that's what I'm doing," Mr Barnett told a press conference. Opponents have pledged to interfere with the program and Australian media reported that shark cull activists had removed bait from drum lines. The WA Department of Fisheries is currently working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program as part of its research and protection program. Shark Monitoring Network Project Manager Mark Kleeman said the new monitor near the Busselton Jetty, 220km south of the state capital Perth, would allow beach safety authorities to know, through near real-time alerts, if a tagged shark was in the vicinity. "Expansion of the satellite-linked network is part of a long-term project to improve safety at West Australian beaches, which will also help scientists better understand the movements of tagged sharks through WA waters," Mr Kleeman said in a government release. Besides the satellite-linked monitors, there are also approximately 320 seabed monitors located around the South and West coasts that record movements of tagged sharks. Mr Kleeman said each time data was physically retrieved from those monitors it would also help to establish a much broader understanding of shark behaviur and movement in WA waters. "338 sharks have now been tagged for the ongoing Shark Monitoring Network project and the ongoing tagging program will continue to help provide even more data," he said.</text>

<title>Toxic towns: People of Mossville 'are like an experiment' - CNN.com</title>
<text>Toxic towns: People of Mossville 'are like an experiment' By David S. Martin, CNN Medical Senior Producer Town says chemicals sicken For decades, Mossville residents have complained about health problems Community suspects 14 chemical plants play a role in cancer and diseases in area Group asked for relocation of residents, free health clinic and lower emissions How safe is the air you're breathing, and where is it coming from Tune in to "Toxic America," a two-night special investigation , with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, June 2 and 3 at 8 p.m. ET. Westlake, Louisiana CNN -- Gather current and former Mossville, Louisiana, residents in a room and you're likely to hear a litany of health problems and a list of friends and relatives who died young. "I got cancer. My dad had cancer. In fact, he died of cancer. It's a lot of people in this area who died of cancer," says Herman Singleton Jr., 51, who also lost two uncles and an aunt to cancer. Singleton and many others in this predominantly African-American community in southwest Louisiana suspect the 14 chemical plants nearby have played a role in the cancer and other diseases they say have ravaged the area. For decades, Mossville residents have complained about their health problems to industry, and to state and federal agencies. Now with a new Environmental Protection Agency administrator outspoken about her commitment to environmental justice, expectations are growing. Herman Singleton Jr. has cancer, so does his father, and he lost two uncles and an aunt to cancer. Debra Ramirez said her sister died of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. Dorothy Felix belongs to a local environmental group asking the government to intervene for health reasons. "I'm pretty hopeful now," say Debra Ramirez, 55, who grew up in Mossville and who lost a sister at 45 of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. "I do see her trying to do the right thing." Lisa Jackson, a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, and the first African-American administrator of the EPA, this year listed environmental justice as one of her seven priorities. And the EPA held a meeting in Mossville last month formally kicking off a study designed to see if the community qualifies as a Superfund site, reserved for the most polluted places in the United States. Superfund site designation would bring federal funding for cleaning up Mossville. Mossville Environmental Action Now MEAN, the local environmental group, has asked government and industry to relocate residents who want to leave, offer a free health clinic and lower emissions from the plants. Superfund relocates residents only as a last resort. "There are people that are getting sick; there are people who are dying because of what is happening in our community. These chemicals are killing us. They will destroy Mossville if nothing happens," says Dorothy Felix of MEAN.

<title>CNN - The debate over environment protection  - April 22, 1996</title>
<text>Web posted at: 3:15 p.m. EDT From Correspondent Jeanne Meserve WASHINGTON CNN -- Congressman Richard Gephardt stands behind the podium, his voice firm and his message clear. "Speaker Gingrich, as we all know, is quite a fan of visiting zoos -- maybe because he knows that by the time the Republicans are through, a lot of these animals might be extinct," the Missouri representative says. Since Republicans gained the majority in Congress, a heated political debate over the environment has erupted. Republicans have threatened to decrease environmental protection standards, while Democrats have fought to uphold them. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, has even called the Environmental Protection Agency "the Gestapo of government." Carol Browner, an EPA administrator, has countered by saying the GOP has "launched an orchestrated, assertive assault" against the agency, ultimately threatening public health and environmental laws. 224K AIFF sound or 224K WAV sound And while the debate has stirred in Washington, a Republican pollster found that "by greater than a 2-to-1 margin, voters have more confidence in the Democrats than Republicans to protect the environment." Clinton's cause Democrats have pounced on the issue. President Clinton on Monday announced that his administration will take up 20 environmental initiatives through legislative and presidential directives. Vice President Al Gore has spoken up for environmental protection, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has declared the environment a priority in international affairs, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has criticized Republicans for their handling of environmental issues. 96K AIFF sound or 96K WAV sound GOP does its share Republicans don't buy it. The GOP says the Clinton administration has a lackluster environmental record. "They haven't done a heck of a lot," says Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-New York. "They've talked a good game. They haven't played a great game." Plus, Republicans point to their past environmental record. President Richard Nixon established the EPA, and President George Bush acted to curb acid rain and the use of chlorofluorocarbons. More recently, the GOP has supported more funding for the Florida Everglades. And House Speaker Newt Gingrich hosted CNN's Larry King Live in which he discussed the importance of exotic animals. Critics like Browner say only the words have changed. 128K AIFF sound or 128K WAV sound "As the governor of Florida asked, 'How can you be for the Everglades and against wetlands'" Browner said. Despite the partisan split, some Congressional leaders have urged bipartisan cooperation. But since this is an election year, bipartisan efforts might just go up in smoke. Feedback</text>

<text>Primaries Environment Most scientists believe that a rise in the Earth's temperatures is worsened by the effect of greenhouse gases. The debate centers on how much government should regulate industry and whether that will affect climate change or be an expensive boondoggle. Read the stances of the presidential candidates below. The views of the vice presidential candidates are shown where available. REPUBLICANS John McCain Introduced the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 with Sen. Joseph Lieberman I-CT. The legislation is designed to significantly reduce the nation's greenhouse gases, accomplished through a combination of trading markets and the deployment of advanced technologies. Would propose use of alternative energy sources, including nuclear. Sarah Palin Asked by ABC News in September, 2008, whether she believes global warming is the result of a natural cycle or human activity, Palin said, "I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now." However, around the same time, she was quoted by conservative Newsmax magazine, as saying, "A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. ... I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made." DEMOCRATS Barack Obama Would implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level recommended by top scientists. Would make the United States a leader in the global effort to combat climate change by leading anew international global warming partnership. Would establish a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS to speed the introduction of low-carbon non-petroleum fuels. Would create a Technology Transfer program within the Department of Energy dedicated to exporting climate-friendly technologies to developing countries. Would offer incentives to maintain forests globally and manage them sustainably. Would develop domestic incentives that reward forest owners, farmers and ranchers when they plant trees, restore grasslands or undertake farming practices that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Joe Biden Co-sponsored a 2006 Senate bill that said global warming "was a threat to international stability as well as a risk to the environment and our economy." In a statement released by Biden's Senate office in May, 2006, he said, "The scientific evidence is clear: We need to take significant steps toward worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases to avoid permanently altering our climate." Obama and McCain: Key Senate Votes from 2005 through 2008 Greenhouse Gases June 6, 2008 -- The U.S. Senate refuses to limit debate -- by a vote of 48-36 -- on an amendment for a bill that called for the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases. McCain: Did not vote Obama: Did not vote Drilling in Alaska's Artic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR December 21, 2005 -- The U.S. Senate rejects, by a vote of 56-44, a motion to limit debate on fiscal 2006 Defense spending bill that would open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. McCain: Yea Obama: Nay Global Warming June 22, 2005 -- The U.S. Senate rejects -- by a vote of 44-53 -- a motion to table a resolution sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman D-N.M. that expressed the opinion of the Senate on climate change legislation. The legislation addresses the need to control the emission of greenhouse gases. The resolution was then adopted by a voice vote. McCain: Nay</text>

<title>Thinner is better to curb global warming, study says - CNN.com</title>
<text>Thinner is better to curb global warming, study says Story Highlights Transporting heavier people requires more fuel, generating more greenhouse gas Study compared BMI distribution in UK in 1970s with predictions for 2010 Governments should encourage active transportation, study author says By Elizabeth Landau CNN CNN -- Here's yet another reason to stay in shape: Thinner people contribute less to global warming, according to a new study. More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and about 300 million are obese. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study showing that, because of food production and transportation factors, a population of heavier people contributes more harmful gases to the planet than a population of thin people. Given that it takes more energy to move heavier people, transportation of heavier people requires more fuel, which creates more greenhouse gas emissions, the authors write. "The main message is staying thin. It's good for you, and it's good for the planet," said Phil Edwards, senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The study offers this novel approach to the global warming problem as U.S. lawmakers discuss the future of climate change legislation. This week, the the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin on a comprehensive energy and climate bill. On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that six greenhouse gases pose potential health hazards, an announcement that could prompt the regulation of the gases. More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and about 300 million are obese , the study said. Generally, the body mass index, a measure of obesity, is increasing in most countries worldwide, from China to European countries to the United States. BMI is going up because of the availability of food and motorized transportation, Edwards said. People are less active now than they were 30 years ago, and the prevalence of fast food has given people less healthy, more energy-dense options. Health Library Using statistical models, the authors compared the distribution of BMI in the United Kingdom in the 1970s -- when 3.5 percent of the population was obese -- with a prediction for the country's BMI distribution in 2010, reflecting 40 percent obesity. "In terms of environmental impact, the lean population has a much smaller carbon footprint," Edwards said. The population with 40 percent obese people requires 19 percent more food energy for its total energy expenditure than the population with 3.5 percent obese people, the study showed. This 19 percent increase in food consumption translates into an increase of 270 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the study said. "The findings make sense and highlight an important global co-benefit of losing weight, along with the significant personal health benefits," said Patrick Kinney, associate professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. In terms of obesity rate, the U.S. population is not far off from the overweight population model in this study. The country has 33.3 percent obese people, according to the Mayo Clinic. The study suggests that governments have a responsibility to encourage people to be more physically active, Edwards said. Active transportation, such as cycling and walking, helps maintain a healthy weight but requires safe streets, he said. "If the government wants to promote active transport, which would be good for the environment and for individual health, it needs to make the environment safe to do that," he said. Although climate change has come into the forefront as a major world problem recently, this is not the first time scholars have thought about the connection between fossil fuel and body fat. In 1978, a year the United States experienced an oil shock, a study in the American Journal of Public Health showed that if all overweight people in the country aged 18 to 79 reached their optimal weight, the resulting energy savings would equal 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline. After the dieting period, about 750 million gallons of gasoline would be saved every year, said the authors, Bruce Hannon, professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and Timothy Lohman, now professor emeritus at the University of Arizona. Today, research has shown that the obesity epidemic costs the United States about $100 billion a year, said Dr. Martin Donohoe of Portland State University, who runs the Web site Public Health and Social Justice. In terms of energy expenditure, the average food product travels 1,500 miles to get to your table, he said. Some measures to curb obesity include making healthier meals available in schools, putting nutritional information on food packages and menus, and banning trans fats, he said.</text>

<title>EU launches military operation in Central African Republic - CNN.com</title>
<text>EU launches military operation in Central African Republic By Tom Watkins, CNN updated 1:24 PM EDT, Tue April 1, 2014 A muslim woman sits in the courtyard of the Catholic church of Bossamptele where she has taken refuge on March 7, 2014. STORY HIGHLIGHTS EU forces will operate in the capital city of Bangui and in the airport "It is vital that there is a return to public order as soon as possible," EU says Central African Republic was plunged into chaos last year after ouster of the President CNN -- Help is on the way. The European Union announced in a news release that it is launching a military operation to restore stability to the Central African Republic. The operation's mission "is to provide temporary support in achieving a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area, with a view to handing over to a U.N. peacekeeping operation or to African partners," it said. "The force will thereby contribute both to international efforts to protect the populations most at risk and to the creation of the conditions for providing humanitarian aid." HRW: People cheered lynching of Muslims Archbishop and imam unite U.N.: Half of all C.A.R. citizens need aid Central African Republic president quits The forces -- known by the acronym EUFOR RCA -- will operate in the capital city of Bangui and in its airport. "The launch of this operation demonstrates the EU's determination to take full part in international efforts to restore stability and security in Bangui and right across the Central African Republic," said Catherine Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy and vice president of the commission, in a statement. "It is vital that there is a return to public order as soon as possible, so that the political transition process can be put back on track." Though the announcement did not say how many troops were to be sent, a news briefing was scheduled for Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, with Maj. Gen. Philippe Ponties, commander of the operation. Also on Wednesday, a high-level meeting to be held in the margins of the EU-Africa summit was to include several African and European heads of state as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops in December after a U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention. The African nation was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels known as Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. Attempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn country have prompted "a Muslim exodus of historic proportions," Amnesty International has warned. In a statement last month , it said that areas of the capital were increasingly controlled by Christian militias, which have filled the power vacuum created by Bozize's ouster and attacked civilians and African Union-led peacekeepers. "This flare-up in violence is cause for serious concern, given the backdrop of ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity across the Central African Republic since last December," said Christian Mukosa, the organization's Central Africa researcher. "It is just further evidence of what Amnesty International has been saying for months -- that the small contingent of peacekeeping troops on the ground will not be able to protect civilians effectively without more help from the international community." Since March 22, the Red Cross has recorded at least 15 civilian deaths in Bangui, and Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has treated dozens of people for life-threatening wounds sustained in attacks. The attacks have taken place despite the installation in January of a transitional government and the presence of 6,000 African Union-led troops and 2,000 French soldiers. "Extrajudicial executions, torture, looting and other atrocities are perpetrated against civilians on a daily basis," Amnesty said. "The organization was the first to document ethnic cleansing of the country's Muslim population in January: thousands have since fled to neighbouring countries where they are now facing another humanitarian catastrophe due to dire living conditions."

"The launch of this operation demonstrates the EU's determination to take full part in international efforts to restore stability and security in Bangui and right across the Central African Republic," said Catherine Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy and vice president of the commission, in a statement. "It is vital that there is a return to public order as soon as possible, so that the political transition process can be put back on track." Though the announcement did not say how many troops were to be sent, a news briefing was scheduled for Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, with Maj. Gen. Philippe Ponties, commander of the operation. Also on Wednesday, a high-level meeting to be held in the margins of the EU-Africa summit was to include several African and European heads of state as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
