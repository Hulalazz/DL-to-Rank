<title>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN updated 8:56 PM EST, Wed January 22, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS This week is the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision The abortion issue is just as contentious as it was in 1973 The Pope tweeted his sentiments as thousands of pro-life marchers rallied in Washington Abortion remains a hot-button political issue at the federal and state levels Washington CNN -- The abortion issue is far from settled. It's just as contentious today as it has ever been in the United States. Wednesday's 41st anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which upheld legalized abortion before about 24 weeks, ignited the polarized, emotional battle. What's happening In sum, the Pope tweeted, thousands gathered, politicians pontificated. Anti-abortion activists have a bigger megaphone as it has come to remember the day they say the unborn lost their rights. Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall in the annual "March for Life" rally that drew buses of activists. This year they braved the snow that fell Tuesday and below freezing temperatures that followed. Pope Francis showed his solidarity , tweeting "I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable." Politicians sent releases, including Sen. Ted Cruz. "Every human life is a precious gift from God, and our law should protect innocent human life," the Texas Republican said. What's changed Thousands converge for March on Life GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape GOP tackles the abortion war In the abortion debate, each side tries to out maneuver the other. But the game is becoming more intense, complicated and consuming. Opinion: Why progressives should be pro-life Both sides are working at the local, state and federal level to pass laws. Obviously the anti-choice advocates want laws that restrict access to abortion while pro-choice proponents are working for measures that increase access to abortion care and options. Both sides are focusing on the court system, too, working to place judges that have a tremendous amount of clout in shutting down or allowing abortion-related laws. Who's winning The answer is not so cut and dry, but last year was a big year for anti-choice advocates. Even the president of one of the largest women's rights groups admitted that the anti-choice side made some inroads. "Things are in a crisis," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said. "The number of bills that have moved in the state legislature are definitely concerning." According to the group, 24 states adopted 53 anti-choice measures in 2013, including one in North Dakota that outlaws abortion as early as six weeks of gestation. Effectively outlawing abortion as many women don't know they are pregnant at six weeks. On the flip side, 10 states have adopted only 16 pro-choice measures, mostly involving access to care and contraception. What's Congress doing about it Not much. But efforts are in motion. After Republicans gained the majority in the House in 2010, they have been working to roll back access to abortion. Republican lawmakers launched a comprehensive attack on Planned Parenthood, women's health clinics that provide abortion services, working to cut their federal funding. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, caused major debates over abortion as opponents said it allows federal funding to be used for abortion services or providers who offer them. Supporters disagree as Democrats agreed to tighten language. The House passed the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act" that restricts abortions at 20 weeks, citing evidence that fetus feel pain at that time. But the measure is stalled in the Senate and President Barack Obama has vowed to veto it should it reach his desk. Does politics have anything to do with it Free Speech vs. Abortion Rights Dissecting the pope's in-depth interview Everything. While it won't make a campaign, it can surely break it. The Republican National Committee, which is holding its annual conference this week, put its events on hold and encouraged members to attend the "March for Life" rally. Abortion is a key topic of this year's meeting as a coalition of RNC members are introducing a resolution that encourages Republican candidates to "support Republican pro-life candidates who fight back against Democratic deceptive 'war on women' rhetoric by pointing out the extreme positions on abortion held by Democratic opponents." First on CNN: GOP urges candidates to stand ground on abortion It spurred Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' campaign. The issue launched her to political notoriety after she mounted a filibuster in the Texas legislature opposing restrictive abortion measures. But since she launched her candidacy, she's had to talk about a lot more than the abortion. Democrats are willing to highlight the issue when it frames Republican positions on abortion as extreme. "Last year, the GOP said they needed to reach out to women, but instead they've decided their plan is to spend more time fighting to restrict the rights of women to make their own health care choices," Democratic National Committee chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Rarely do candidates run on the issue and win. But the issue can doom candidates who make controversial remarks. In 2012, Missouri Senate hopeful Todd Akin's campaign took a nose dive after the Republican, who opposes abortion in all circumstances, made incendiary remarks. Democrats have worked to optimize Republican stances on abortion. They say the Republicans have launched a "war on women" and pounded the issue in campaign ads and stump speeches. Do people care Yes and no. While it's a topic that evokes strong opinions, it's unlikely that people will pick a candidate solely on the issue. According to a May CNN poll, 25% of people thought abortion should be legal in all circumstances compared to 20% thought it should be legal in no situation. A Gallup Poll released last week found that respondents thought abortion was one of the least important issues that the government address. It came in 17 out of 19 topics. What's next The Supreme Court is hearing three cases involving the issue, including McCullen v. Coakley, which challenges the buffer zone law in Massachusetts that creates a safe space around reproductive health care facilities. And there's also the Hobby Lobby case , which will be heard this spring. The chain store has asked the court to exempt it from providing contraception and "abortion-inducing drug" health coverage to their workers, which is required under the Affordable Care Act. And lawmakers will continue the battle around the country.</text>

<title>Abortion law ruling a win for women (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion law ruling a win for women By John C. Jennings updated 8:36 PM EDT, Mon August 4, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS John Jennings: Court strikes down Alabama law that erects barriers for abortion doctors He says law purported to protect women, but instead bars them from medical care Hospital privileges requirement an anti-abortion ruse. Abortion a very safe procedure, he says Jennings: Legislators who truly care about women's safety will work to prevent these laws Editor's note: John C. Jennings is president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- On Monday, a federal court struck down Alabama's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital. The court called the justification for the law "exceedingly weak." As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine. John C. Jennings Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws a number of states have adopted them do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety. That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them. Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications. For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare. View my Flipboard Magazine. Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis. It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period. In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations. Mississippi puts 'personhood' on ballot Court strikes down abortion buffer zones Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals. As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin. These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible. Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.</text>

<title>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban By Ann Furedi, abortion charity CEO, Special to CNN updated 8:31 AM EST, Tue February 18, 2014 Women protest in Madrid against the proposed changes to Spain's abortion law . STORY HIGHLIGHTS Spain's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape victims or women who would suffer lasting harm It would effectively reverse a 2010 law allowing abortion on request for the first 14 weeks Ann Furedi says Spanish woman would have to travel to other countries for terminations Furedi says women should be able to make a decision in line with their own moral values Editor's note: Ann Furedi is the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service -- a registered charity and the largest single abortion provider in the UK. It also offers other services such as pregnancy testing, counseling and STI screening. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. For a contrasting view point, click here. CNN -- Spain's controversial, and highly restrictive, new abortion law is now before Parliament, with approval looming . If passed this would mean that abortions will be permitted in only two circumstances: rape, and risk of "lasting harm" to the mother's health. The move would effectively reverse the abortion law of 2010, which permitted abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and up to 22 weeks where there was serious risk of fetal anomaly. Contrasting view: 'No unborn child is unworthy of legal protection' Ann Furedi The widespread opposition, both within Spain and elsewhere in Europe, indicates that the Popular Party's interest in the abortion law is not underwritten by a wider public and political desire to restrict abortion access. Throughout most countries in the developed world, with notable exceptions such as the Republic of Ireland, women's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services, which are often publicly funded. But the Spanish situation provides a shocking reminder of how quickly things can change in a country -- and the extreme consequences this can have for women. Back in 2004, a British newspaper wrongly accused British Pregnancy Advisory Service BPAS of referring women to Spain, when they were "too late" to have an abortion in Britain. The reality was that doctors in Spain were, at that time, legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24-week "time limit" permitted by British law. In the extremely rare cases where women were desperate to access abortion late in pregnancy, they would sometimes find that only a Spanish clinic was able to help them. Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape Texas abortion restrictions overturned Ireland abortion bill vote The Spanish law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations, but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy. Yet barely five years on, Spanish women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation. Will this mean that their need for abortion goes away Of course not. What it means is that Spanish women, like Irish women, will be forced to travel for care to Britain and other European countries. The Irish experience shows with heartbreaking clarity that when a nation makes abortion illegal, it does not prevent women's need for abortion, or their determination to access safe procedures. Outlawing abortion simply sends the issue overseas , increasing the financial and emotional cost to women and, of course, the gestation at which they are able to access a termination. Politicians in the 21st century must accept that abortion is a necessary back-up to contraception, and that it should be a woman's private and personal decision that she is able to make according to what she thinks is best for her and her family. It is a travesty that abortion is included in the criminal statute in so many countries -- including Britain. As a moral matter it should be for a woman to decide in line with her values; she should be allowed to take responsibility for life and choose what she thinks is best. As a medical matter, if should be regulated like any other medical procedure. This point was put very nicely by the London Times in December 2013, in a leading article challenging the new Spanish law. "To bring the criminal law into an issue of women's health and conscientious reflection is an abuse of government power," argued this establishment newspaper . "A constitutional society does not intrude into areas of personal judgment that most citizens consider fall within the authority of the family. Social engineering is the practice of autocratic governments." Spain is heading towards a self-made mess. We know from the situation in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, what the consequences of its new law are likely to be. The lesson for other governments is that they should stay out of women's personal decisions. "Nosotras Decidimos," proclaim the Spanish women's organizations protesting against their inhumane new law -- "We Decide." Throughout Europe, organizations such as BPAS will be standing behind them, and providing the services that these women need. But how much better it would be if they could access this care at home - as, until so recently, they could. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ann Furedi.

<title>Opinion: Why abortions are way down - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why abortions are way down By Timothy Stanley updated 9:54 AM EST, Tue February 4, 2014 Young anti-abortion demonstrators at the annual March of Life on the National Mall last month STORY HIGHLIGHTS Timothy Stanley: New study shows abortion rate at lowest point since 1973 He says politics of issue remain at high point. Reason is mass culture, politics drifting apart Many reasons for abortion drop. Better contraception, shifting views among young people Stanley: Politicians against abortion must face complexities of issue to be relevant Editor's note: Timothy Stanley is a historian at Oxford University and blogs for Britain's The Daily Telegraph. He is the author of "The Crusader: The Life and Times of Pat Buchanan." CNN -- The U.S. abortion rate is at its lowest point since 1973. In 2011, there were fewer than 17 terminations for every 1,000 women ; a fall of 13% since 2008 and only a little higher than when the Supreme Court handed down Roe v. Wade. You might not guess that's the way things are trending from what politicians have to say about the issue, given that they tend to prefer to discuss morals or rights rather than practicalities and realities. These numbers confirm that politics and mass culture are drifting further and further apart. What's caused the fall in abortions Some might be tempted to assume it's the various Republican-led state measures to restrict access to abortion; these include compelling abortion clinics to maintain the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers, which is for many clinics almost impossible to achieve. But most of those state efforts only started recently, so they can't explain a long-term trend against abortion since a peak of 29 terminations per 1,000 women in 1980 . Timothy Stanley According to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute, which released the new study , the latest decline is largely the result of improved birth control. In tough economic times, they argue, people tend to pay greater attention to contraception because they are more aware of the potential material costs of becoming pregnant. Also, the arrival of new kinds of contraceptives on the market, such as long-term intrauterine devices, means people aren't relying on pills and condoms that can fail. Abortion rates lowest in 40 years But, surely, equally important is a quiet revolution in popular attitudes toward abortion. According to Gallup, in 1996 some 56% of Americans self-identified as pro-choice and 33% as pro-life. By 2013, only 45% called themselves pro-choice while 48% said pro-life. Part of the reason may be greater awareness of what a termination involves. Improvements in technology have made it easier to visualize and comprehend the fetus early on in development. The debate over late-term abortion has encouraged some to think of that fetus' potential. Ironically, Hollywood, which is expressly liberal, may have helped. Anti-abortion activists have talked about a "Juno effect," crediting the movie Juno, which is about a pregnant teenager who chooses to keep the child, with persuading many girls to see adoption or motherhood as better options than termination. Likewise, the Twilight series bear with me here promotes chastity, a borderline terror of male sexuality if a vampire bites you, he just can't stop and its lead character chooses to keep her baby even though the pregnancy nearly kills her. Meanwhile, movies like "The Ides of March" present abortion as something that occurs entirely for the convenience of men a political handler learns that an intern with whom he's just had a one-night stand already is pregnant from a one-night stand with his candidate boss, drops her off to have an abortion and she later kills herself. It's uneven, to be sure, but youth culture is witnessing at least some blending of conservative and feminist values that encourage -- not necessarily pressure -- girls to choose either to hold out or embrace motherhood. Huckabee: Women don't need 'Uncle Sugar' NARAL Pres.: abortion restrictions up to states Any room for compromise on abortion Thousands converge for March on Life There is no one explanation but rather a synthesis of medical, cultural and economic forces at work here. All of which paints a far more complex picture than the one we find in politics. Which is disappointing. Many liberals speak of the need for abortion to be "safe, legal and rare," and even Hillary Clinton has called it "sad" and "tragic." But liberal legislators have consistently voted against even the most reasonable attempts to make it rarer; witness the partisan voting in the House o n the recently proposed 20-week abortion ban. Many conservatives, at a national level, still talk in terms of a hypothetical federal ban that would put them up against the Supreme Court and potentially outlaw abortion in the cases when many voters would regard it as a tragic necessity. You may recall, with understandable disgust, Republican conversations about degrees of rape during the last election. It's one of the reasons so many lost. Most Americans do not see abortion in these stark, simplistic terms. If they have slowly trended toward identifying themselves as pro-life, it is probably because the label reflects the flowering of a strong ideal "I'd like there to be no abortions" tempered by a quiet acceptance of reality "But I know they will continue". Who, then, should these citizens vote for As a pro-lifer, I'd love to see a presidential candidate who better reflects the subtleties of what is one of the most painful, nuanced matters of our age -- be it a Republican who talks more about making having a child a positive, affordable decision thanks to better health care or educational opportunities, or a Democrat who says "safe, legal and rare" and actually means it. In the absence of that, we have to trust the people. And it's heartening to see so many more than ever before choosing life. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

<title>Irish Parliament passes exception to abortion ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Irish Parliament passes exception to abortion ban By Michael Martinez and Ben Brumfield, CNN updated 6:47 AM EDT, Fri July 12, 2013 A protester displays a banner against Ireland's abortion laws in Dublin on November 24. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Human Rights Watch says the bill fails women in Ireland by not going far enough The final bill includes a provision allowing abortion if the mother is at risk of suicide The majority government supports the bill Conservative and progressive lawmakers argue over various amendments CNN -- Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly passed new legislation early Friday that allows abortions if the mother's life is at risk. Members of Parliament in the devoutly Catholic country spent hours before its passage debating the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013. The vote was 127-31 in favor of the bill. Conservative and progressive lawmakers argued over amendments to the draft law. Religious lawmakers and church leaders are upset over a provision allowing abortion if a pregnant woman is acutely at risk of committing suicide. They called it a "Trojan horse" leading to easy abortion access and wanted it removed, but the provision was included in the final bill, according to The Irish Times. Ireland abortion bill vote Historic abortion vote planned in Ireland A woman can't just threaten to commit suicide and expect to receive an abortion, according to the bill. Two psychiatrists and an obstetrician must certify that the risk of suicide is "real and substantial." Female lawmakers introduced an amendment to permit abortions if a woman becomes pregnant after incest or rape, but later shelved it when it ran into resistance, the Times reported. In its final provisions, the bill underlines existing Irish laws to protect the fetus. "It shall be an offense to intentionally destroy unborn human life," it reads. A woman who violates the law could face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The bill has proved divisive even within the government. European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton, who was opposed to elements of the legislation, resigned Thursday, Prime Minister Enda Kenny confirmed. Doctors and hospital personnel involved in illegal abortions face the same punishment, according to the bill. The issue was brought to the forefront last year when a 31-year-old woman died after doctors refused to perform a life-saving abortion. Savita Halappanavar went into a hospital in Galway, Ireland, in October, complaining of severe back pain. Doctors established Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, was having a miscarriage. But they did not terminate the pregnancy, afraid the law would not allow it. Three days after the request for a termination was made, the fetus died and was removed. Four days later, Savita died of a blood infection. Public outrage over her death likely hastened the passage of the new legislation. It was proposed after a 2010 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, but had been moving slowly through the legislative system. The European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland's failure to regulate access to abortion had led to a violation of its human rights obligations. Twenty years ago, the Irish Supreme Court ruled abortions are allowed when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother. But the ruling was never enacted into law, meaning there was little clarity for doctors or patients as to when an abortion could not take place. Human Rights Watch said the new legislation failed Ireland's women by not going far enough to reform the country's abortion laws. It did "the bare minimum" to comply with the European court ruling, and did not address other issues such as the rights of women who are pregnant as a result of rape, it said in a statement. "The new law does add clarity, but requiring women to seek multiple approvals from health professionals may delay or defeat access to legal abortions," said Gauri van Gulik, women's rights advocate for Human Rights Watch. "Ultimately it does little to improve the draconian restrictions on abortions."</text>

<title>Let's get real about abortions - CNN.com</title>
<text>Let's get real about abortions By David Frum, CNN Contributor updated 9:12 AM EDT, Mon October 29, 2012 Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's comment about rape sparked a firestorm of discussion. STORY HIGHLIGHTS David Frum: People often neglect the economic reasons behind the choice to have an abortion He says those trying to reduce abortion need an answer to how to help women in need Frum: Abortion rates fell in 1990s economic boom Germany, which has generous maternity benefits, has much lower abortion rate, he says Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is the author of seven books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002. CNN -- When Richard Mourdock delivered his notorious answer about rape and abortion, I was sorry that the debate moderator failed to follow up with the next question: "OK, Mr. Mourdock, you say your principles require a raped woman to carry the rapist's child to term. That's a heavy burden to impose on someone. What would you do for her in return Would you pay her medical expenses Compensate her for time lost to work Would you pay for the child's upbringing College education "If a woman has her credit card stolen, her maximum liability under federal law is $50. Yet on your theory, if she is raped, she must endure not only the trauma of assault, but also accept economic costs of potentially many thousands of dollars. Must that burden also fall on her alone When we used to draft men into the Army, we gave them veterans' benefits afterward. If the state now intends to conscript women into involuntary childbearing, surely those women deserve at least an equally generous deal" That question sounds argumentative, and I suppose it is. David Frum But there's a serious point here, and it extends well beyond the anguishing question of sexual assault. If you're serious about reducing abortion, the most important issue is not which abortions to ban. The most important issue is how will you support women to have the babies they want. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter . We welcome your ideas and comments. As a general rule, societies that do the most to support mothers and child-bearing have the fewest abortions. Societies that do the least to support mothers and child-bearing have more abortions. Germany, for example, operates perhaps the world's plushest welfare state. Working women receive 14 weeks of maternity leave, during which time they receive pay from the state. The state pays a child allowance to the parents of every German child for potentially as many as 25 years, depending on how long as the child remains in school. Women who leave the work force after giving birth receive a replacement wage from the state for up to 14 months. McCain: Mourdock should say he was wrong Uproar over Mourdock abortion remarks Senate candidate clarifies rape comment Maybe not coincidentally, Germany has one of the lowest abortion rates, about one-third that of the United States. Yet German abortion laws are not especially restrictive. Abortion is legal during the first trimester of pregnancy and available if medically or psychologically necessary in the later trimesters. Even here in the United States, where parental benefits are much less generous, abortion responds to economic conditions. In the prosperous 1990s, abortion rates declined rapidly. In the less prosperous '00s, abortion rates declined more slowly. When the economy plunged into crisis in 2008, abortion rates abruptly rose again . These trends should not surprise anyone. Women choose abortion for one overwhelming reason: economic insecurity. The large majority of women who chose abortion in 2008, 57%, reported a disruptive event in their lives in the previous 12 months: most often, the loss of a job or home. Of the women who choose abortion, 58% are in their 20s. Some 61% of them already have a child. Almost 70% of them are poor or near poor. Three-quarters say they cannot afford another child. Pro-life and pro-choice debaters delight in presenting each other with exquisitely extreme moral dilemmas: "Would you ban abortion even in case of rape" "Would you permit abortion even when done only to select the sex of the child" These dorm-room hypotheticals do not have very much to do with the realities of abortion in the U.S. and elsewhere. Here's an interesting example of those realities: The Netherlands has one of the the most liberal abortion laws in the world. Yet for a long time, the Netherlands also reported one of the world's lowest abortion rates. That low incidence abruptly began to rise in the mid-1990s. Between 1996 and 2003, the abortion rate in the Netherlands jumped by 31% over seven years. What changed The Guttmacher Institute, the leading source of data on reproductive health worldwide, cites "a growing demand for terminations from women in ethnic minority groups residing in the country." Well over half of all abortions performed on teenagers in the Netherlands are performed on girls of non-Dutch origins. These girls and women weren't being raped. They weren't selecting for the sex of their child. They chose abortion because they had become sexually active within male-dominated immigrant subcultures in which access to birth control was restricted, in which female sexuality was tightly policed, in which girls who become pregnant outside marriage are disgraced and in which the costs and obligations of childbearing loaded almost entirely on women alone. Abortion is a product of poverty and maternal distress. A woman who enjoys the most emotional and financial security and who has chosen the timing of her pregnancy will not choose abortion, even when abortion laws are liberal. A woman who is dominated, who is poor and who fears bearing the child is likely to find an abortion, even where abortion is restricted, as it was across the United States before 1965. Santorum: Mourdock criticism 'gotcha politics' So maybe at the next candidates' debate, a journalist will deflect the discussion away from "what if" and instead ask this: "Rather than tell us what you'd like to ban, tell us please what you think government should do to support more happy and healthy childbearing, to reduce unwanted pregnancies and to alleviate the economic anxieties of mothers-to-be" Those are the questions that make the difference. It's amazing how little we talk about them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum. Part of complete coverage on</text>

<title>Dominican Republic abortion ban stops treatment for pregnant teen with cancer - CNN.com</title>
<text>Dominican Republic abortion ban stops treatment for pregnant teen with cancer By Rafael Romo, Senior Latin American Affairs Editor updated 7:43 AM EDT, Wed July 25, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS A 16-year-old girl with leukemia hasn't received treatment because she's pregnant Article 37 of the Dominican Republic's constitution forbids abortion Chemotherapy for the girl's illness will likely terminate her pregnancy Incident has sparked a renewed debate on abortion laws in the country Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic CNN -- In the Dominican Republic, a ban on abortion is preventing a teenage girl from receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease. At the Semma Hospital in the captial city of Santo Domingo, a 16-year-old girl is dying of acute leukemia. Doctors say the girl, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, needs an aggressive chemotherapy treatment. But there's one problem: the teenager is nine weeks pregnant and treatment would very likely terminate the pregnancy, a violation of Dominican anti-abortion laws. Rosa Hernandez, the girl's mother, is trying to convince doctors and the Dominican government to make an exception so that her daughter's life can be saved. "My daughter's life is first. I know that [abortion] is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first," Hernandez said. According to Article 37 of the Dominican constitution, "the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death." Dominican courts have interpreted this as a strict mandate against abortion. Article 37, passed in 2009, also abolished the death penalty. Turkish women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion Miguel Montalvo, the director of the bioethics council that rules on the application of the law, says the council is leaning toward allowing the treatment. "At the end of the day the patient may decide for himself or herself. In this case, the family may decide what's more convenient for the patient," Montalvo said. Women's and human rights groups are outraged, saying the girl should have received chemotherapy immediately. Lilliam Fondeur, a women's rights activist, complains that conservative politics is preventing necessary treatment to save the teenager's life. "How can it be possible that so much time is being wasted That the treatment hasn't begun yet because they're still meeting, trying to decide if she has the right to receive the treatment to save her life -- that's unacceptable," Fondeur said. Some Dominican opposition lawmakers say there should be a new debate over the abortion ban in the Caribbean country and the problems created by the constitutional ban go beyond this case. Opinion leaders like former representative Victor Terrero say clandestine abortions are also putting the lives of many women at risk. "The constitution is going to have to be modified sooner rather than later," Terrero said. "We cannot allow under any circumstances that pregnancies that present complications for women be permitted to continue as normal." Bautista Rojas Gomez, the Dominican minister of health, has publicly indicated he favors chemotherapy over protecting the pregnancy, but doctors are still reluctant to act for fear of prosecution. Pelegrin Castillo, one of the architects of Article 37, says the constitutional ban does not prevent doctors from administering the treatment. It does, however, prevent them from practicing an abortion in order to treat the patient with chemotherapy. "It's an artificial debate," Castillo said. "What we have clearly said is that in this case doctors are authorized by the constitution to treat the patient. They don't have to worry about anything. They have the mandate of protecting both lives." And while the debate rages on around the country, back at the hospital the clock keeps ticking for the 16-year-old pregnant girl.

<title>Michael Moore: Capitalism has proven it's failed - CNN.com</title>
<text>CNN/Money: Understanding the G20 King: You're in that 1 percent, though Moore: I don't think I'm in that 1 percent, but I make documentary films. But I mean, obviously, I do well because my films have done well. But, you know, even if I were, I think it's my responsibility -- my moral duty that if I've done well, that I have to make sure that everybody else. King: Does well too or has a chance Moore: Well, has at least a chance but that -- and that the pie is divided fairly amongst the people and not just a few people get the majority of the loot and everybody else has to struggle for the crumbs. King: Are you saying capitalism is a failure Moore: Yes. Capitalism. Yes. Well, I don't have to say it. Capitalism, in the last year, has proven that it's failed. All the basic tenets of what we've talked about the free market, about free enterprise and competition just completely fell apart. As soon as they lost, essentially, our money, they came running to the federal government for a bailout -- for welfare, for socialism. And I thought the basic principle of capitalism was that it's a sink-or-swim situation. And those who do well, the cream rises to the top and, you know, those who invest their money wrongly or, you know, don't run their business the right way, then they don't do well. Watch Moore talk about corporate greed And if you run your business the wrong way, where does it say that you or I or anybody watching this has to bail them out I understand why everybody seemed to get behind it, because a lot of people were afraid, because these people down on Wall Street had taken our money and made bets with it. I mean, they essentially created this invisible virtual casino with people's money -- people's pension funds, people's 401ks. They took this money and they made bets. And then they made bets on the bets. And then they took out insurance policies on the bets. And then they took out insurance against the insurance -- the credit default swaps. King: You started filming before Lehman Brothers went belly up. Moore: Yes. King: The stock market tanked. Now, how did the events, as it occurred, affect the movie Did it change gears Moore: It didn't change in terms of what I was looking at, but it did, obviously, offer probably the best example of why this is a system that is really corrupt at its core -- corrupt because it doesn't, it isn't run with democratic -- small "d" -- democratic principles. There's no democracy in our economy. You and I and the people watching have no say in how this economy is run. The upper 1 percent, the people down on Wall Street, the corporate executives, they're the people that control this economy. King: And they don't want to see the economy do well They don't want to see people... Moore: Oh, they sure do. King: Don't they want people to make money so they can buy the products I mean it's silly if they want people unemployed Moore: Oddly enough, yes. King: Why Moore: I'll tell you why. Because your employees are your biggest expense. And, as you've noticed in the last few months, as the unemployment rate has gone up, so has the Dow Jones. Now, you'd think, you know, that Wall Street would respond with "Oh, my God, unemployment is going up, you know, this is bad for business." But the reality is, is that Wall Street likes that. They like it when companies fire people because immediately the bottom line is going to show a larger profit. King: Are you saying the investor is more important than the employee Moore: Yes. The investor -- and the investor, these days, they want the short-term, quick profit and they want it now. But in the long-term, here's what happened. When I was on this show 20 years ago, 20 years ago this week, I was here with "Roger and Me". King: I remember. Moore: And General Motors, that year, made a profit of $4 billion. And yet they had just laid off another 30,000 people. Now, why would you lay people off when you're making a record profit of $4 billion I mean that was totally insane. But they thought, well, you know, we can make a bigger profit. Maybe we can make $4.2 billion if we move those jobs to Mexico. And so they're always, you know, we can make a little bit more money if we do this. By firing those workers, Larry, they got rid of the very people who buy their cars.</text>

<title>Campaign 2012: The phony war of markets vs. government - CNN.com</title>
<text>Campaign 2012: The phony war of markets vs. government By Julian Zelizer, CNN Contributor updated 11:05 AM EDT, Mon July 23, 2012 This election is not a choice between government and markets but between priorities within a mix of the two, says Julian Zelizer. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pundits are painting President Obama as the anti-capitalist candidate, says Julian Zelizer But this election is not a choice between government and markets, Zelizer says Liberals have been firm supporters of capitalism, he says Zelizer: Conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of American life Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and of the new book " Governing America ." CNN -- In a recent column for The New York Times, David Brooks argued that the nation has now entered into a "capitalism debate." Brooks wrote that President Obama, who he said is feeling defensive about the failure of his policies to revitalize economic growth, has launched an all-out assault on capitalism by depicting Mitt Romney as the embodiment of corrupt and vicious economic practices. The president's decision to focus on Romney's work at Bain Capital, Brooks argues, has shifted the "focus of the race from being about big government, which Obama represents, to being about capitalism, which Romney represents." Romney responded in kind, "I'm convinced he wants Americans to be ashamed of success." If this shift continues, the campaigns will spend the next four months presenting voters with a false impression about the the real contest. While both parties have a strong incentive to ramp up the rhetoric to mobilize voters to turn out, this kind of campaign features a debate that has little to do with the governing that will actually take place after the election. Julian Zelizer This election is not a choice between government and markets. The reality is that we will continue to have a system that mixes government and markets, with the political battles centering on the particular priorities that the nation emphasizes within that mix. Obama, as Brooks points out, has not really been a critic of free-market capitalism. His policies have done little to challenge the forces of globalization, and he has worked closely with economic leaders in his efforts to fix the economy. His financial regulation did little to curb the freedom of Wall Street investors. Obama is not some kind of exception among American liberals. Indeed, since Franklin Roosevelt, American liberals have been firm supporters of American capitalism. Their goals have been to tame the excesses of this economic system and to make capitalism fairer for all Americans. Many of FDR's economic policies, such as the National Recovery Act, depended on voluntary cooperation from big business. FDR backed away from any proposals that entailed the federal government obtaining strong control over managerial decisions. The point of legitimating unions, which happened through the Wagner Act 1935, was to provide workers with some kind of countervailing power to business owners within the capitalism system. Other Democrats, such as Harry Truman, followed in this market-friendly liberal tradition. Lyndon Johnson offered economic assistance to the poor and educational assistance to all students, so that more people could participate and enjoy the fruits that the capitalist system produced. With his support of deregulation and deficit reduction, Jimmy Carter moved market-based Democrats even further to the center. Bill Clinton embraced globalization and believed that nurturing free markets could offer the best opportunities to those struggling at home and abroad. While liberalism has always been a political system that sought to use government to strengthen the market-based economy, conservatives have usually been comfortable with government. Despite their rhetoric, conservatives have accepted that government is an inevitable part of American life. Romney has been no exception. As governor, he was not some kind of radical slasher of government services. The centerpiece of his term was a bold health care initiative that expanded that role of government in ensuring access to health care. Romney cut services, but he also increased all kinds of government fees. During his current campaign, Romney is not talking about eliminating the big-ticket programs like Social Security, and he has firmly defended robust levels of national security spending. Like Obama, Romney reflects his own political tradition. Libertarianism has long been dead among conservatives. During the Cold War, conservatives like Sen. Barry Goldwater and author James Burnham pushed for the government to spend more on the fight against communism. During the 1970s, historian Gareth Davies recounted, many conservatives came to accept federal programs such as education as an inevitable part of domestic life. President Ronald Reagan, the iconic conservative, quickly backed off proposals like an initiative to reduce certain Social Security benefits when they stimulated a strong political backlash, and he left many other kinds of domestic spending, like Medicare or agricultural subsidies, intact. George H.W. Bush brought the federal government into new areas of domestic life, providing, for example, protections for people with disabilities. Congressional conservatives like Newt Gingrich proved that they were not much different, as they too were aware that Americans in red states often depended on the government they lambasted. George W. Bush and the Republican Congress grew government in the early part of this century. Bush pushed several significant domestic initiatives such as No Child Left Behind and a costly prescription drug benefit. Like all Republicans, he did little to take out the massive welfare state of tax exemptions and deductions upon which many industries depend. In 2008, he saved financial markets through government with TARP, not through deregulation. His homeland security program involved an aggressive expansion of government power, and he launched two wars abroad. Like it or not, liberals have always accepted capitalism, and conservatives have proved more than willing to live with, and even to use, the federal government for certain purposes. The debate today is not between big government and free market capitalism but rather about how we should structure our mixture of these two systems. The more we have these kinds of overblown debates, the less voters get a sense of what politicians are actually about and what they'll do once in power. A more realistic debate would be about which portion of the public will have tax cuts extended. Rather than an all or nothing debate, we should hear which specific parts of the budget will be trimmed and where will each candidate try to find more efficiency in government. In terms of the economy, where and how will they use government to stimulate economic investment and to curb the deficit, how else will candidates try to raise revenue. This current rhetoric is not only unrealistic, it fuels public frustration with government by generating false expectations and providing campaign discussions that have little to do with real life in Washington.</text>

<title>Capitalism: A Love Story Review | Movie Reviews and News | EW.com</title>
<text>EW's GRADE B Details Limited Release: Sep 23, 2009; Rated: R; Length: 117 Minutes; Genre:  Documentary ; With:  Michael Moore ; Distributor:  Overture Michael Moore's Capitalism: A Love Story is a blistering, mad-as-hell indictment of everything in America that, according to Moore, has led to our current state of economic peril. The back-scratching greed and corruption, the cult of Wall Street as a casino for elites, the subprime mortgage vendors who operated like loan sharks: Moore pulls the big picture together, and much of the movie about three-fifths of it is urgent, unsettling, and mischievously funny. Yet I wish  oh, how I wish  that Moore had restrained himself from painting America's sins with too broad a brush. Pointing his finger at ''capitalism'' Moore sounds a little too much like Rush Limbaugh getting hot under the collar about ''socialism.'' In both cases, theyâ€™re not making an argument  theyâ€™re demonizing a word. Early on, Moore, who narrates the movie in his trademark tone of bedtime-fairy-tale sarcasm, creates a memorable montage of the '50s and '60s, taking us back to a more secure and, in some ways, egalitarian America. For Moore, the transformative moment was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Capitalism: A Love Story is most potent when it shows us what the financial desperation and ruthless corporate squeezing that descended from that era now look like. There's an astonishing section about companies that take out life-insurance policies on their employees, profiting from their deaths, and Moore squeezes a great deal of symbolic mileage out of the fact that airline pilots have been reduced to beleaguered wage slaves who routinely make less than $20,000 a year. Then there's the federal government's $700 billion bank bailout, which for Moore is a conspiracy, an officially sanctioned robbery. Here, as in the health-care doc Sicko 2007, Moore's real subject is the collapse of the social contract. That's a powerful theme, but why did he have to make the film's villain nothing less thanâ€¦capitalism itself Moore depicts the very concept of American free enterprise as inherently unjust. But even if you believe that deregulation in the '80s went too far, that unchecked capitalism is a voracious beast that can eat a culture alive, you may have a hard time swallowing the film's finale, in which Moore trashes our system as ''evil'' and pushes for a citizens' ''revolt.'' At its best, Capitalism: A Love Story is a searing outcry against the excesses of a cutthroat time. At its worst, it's dorm-room Marxism. B</text>

<text>Ahmadinejad blames capitalism for global woes By the CNN Wire Staff Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is on a public relations offensive in New York, addressing the session on tackling world poverty. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ahmadinejad says the world needs to revert to a "divine mind-set" His visit is not without protest He has suggested the U.S. release Iranians he says are illegally arrested He will appear on CNN's "Larry King Live" Wednesday United Nations CNN -- Attending a United Nations session on alleviating world poverty Tuesday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed capitalism for the world's woes. "The demanding liberal capitalism and transnational corporations have caused the suffering of countless women, men and children in so many countries," Ahmadinejad said at a U.N. General Assembly session on the Millennium Development Goals. "It is my firm belief that in the new millennium, we need to revert to the divine mind-set, to our true nature for which man was created and, indeed, to the just and fair governance," he said. At past global conferences, Ahmadinejad's strong words against Israel have prompted world leaders to walk out. But the hard-line Iranian leader's comments Tuesday were relatively tempered. "Now that the discriminatory order of capitalism and the hegemonic approaches are facing defeat and are getting close to their end, all-out participation in upholding justice and prosperous interrelations is essential," he said. Video: Peres: Peace will succeed Video: U.N. agenda: Poverty, Afghanistan Video: Sarah Shourd's homecoming Video: Sarah Shourd's bittersweet return Ahmadinejad is on a public relations offensive this week in New York, addressing the session on tackling world poverty, giving interviews and speaking again Thursday in the assembly's general debate. On Wednesday he will appear on CNN's "Larry King Live." His visit coincides with the homecoming of American Sarah Shourd, who was accused of spying against Iran and detained in a Tehran prison for 14 months. Ahmadinejad has suggested the Obama administration ought to return the humanitarian gesture by releasing Iranians he says were illegally arrested and detained in the United States. The United States says the cases are not related. Ahmadinejad shared the stage Tuesday with world leaders, among them Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. His appearance at the United Nations comes just three months after the Security Council imposed tough new sanctions on Iran to try to force it to suspend its nuclear program. Iran is also under global scrutiny for alleged human rights violations in a crackdown on dissent following last year's disputed elections that returned Ahmadinejad to the presidency. The summit on the Millennium Development Goals is assessing the successes of eight measurable goals set a decade ago that were intended to help halve extreme poverty and alleviate hunger and disease by 2015.

<title>CNN.com - Drowning out 'karaoke capitalism' - Mar 31, 2004</title>
<text>Manage alerts | What is this CNN -- Repetition, standardized recipes and replication are the norm in many business sectors; whether it be mid-sized cars, marketed music, architecture or movie remakes. According to two business gurus, the corporate world is now under siege from "karaoke capitalism" or institutionalized imitation, where copycat firms dominate. "No matter how talented you are in a karaoke bar, you are going to end up being a pale copy of an original," Jonas Ridderstrale told CNN. "We need to realize it is better to be a first rate version of yourself, rather than a second class copy of someone else." The 2003, Thinkers 50 -- the worlds' first ranking of management luminaries -- pegged Dr. Jonas Ridderstrale and Dr. Kjell Nordstrom at number 21. Their brand of business philosophy says companies can only achieve success if they think and act differently from their competitors. "Competing in a world of karaoke capitalism is about daring to be different, it is about writing the songs of the future and not focusing on the tunes of the past," explains Ridderstale. They both look nothing like business school professors and delight in Scandinavian dryness, throwing in philosophy and pop culture into seminars, as well as reveling in firms who raise themselves above the madding crowd. "Dell and Virgin want to change something, make certain parts of society work better or improve a product," explains Nordstrom. Their mantra says that for many consumers in Europe and the U.S., life-long loyalty to a country, a company, a brand, a rock band, a husband or a wife has vanished and people no longer accept standardization in their lives and purchases. "64 percent of all marriages in Sweden end in divorce. From the start people no longer have a sense of loyalty," says Ridderstrale. "If I require a flat made for me -- I do not want a fridge, I want an ice machine. I do not need a bathtub. I prefer two showers." The two Swedes are the authors of international bestsellers "Funky Business" and now "Karaoke Capitalism: Talent makes capital dance." In their latest book they describe the new reality for most corporations -- a consumer landscape under siege from increasingly powerful individuals, who are free to know, go, do and be who they want to be.

<title>Opinion: Bonus waiver a sad day for capitalism - CNN.com</title>
<text>Opinion: Bonus waiver a sad day for capitalism By David Buik, for CNN updated 5:51 AM EST, Tue January 31, 2012 Stephen Hester, chief executive officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland RBS, as pictured in London in November. STORY HIGHLIGHTS David Buik says little correlation between role and remuneration of chairman and CEO He believes political expediency and public opinion bullied Hester into waiving bonus Buik says Hester has done a good job at RBS He says it is shame that Hester's case has not been objectively presented Editor's note: Editor's note: David Buik has spent almost 50 years in the City of London, as an investment banker and broker. He is a partner at BGC Partners and a frequent media commentator on financial matters. CNN -- The announcement on Sunday night that Stephen Hester, the Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, had bowed to political pressure in the UK and decided to waive his bonus -- worth £963,000 $1.5M in shares -- will turn out to be a very sad day for commercial democracy. The UK taxpayer, through the government, owns 82% of RBS, after bailing it out in 2008. If there had been any concern about the democratic process, then UK Financial Investments -- which manages the government-aided financial institutions -- and the UK Treasury should have filled the RBS board with their appointees at the time, rather than rely on commercial appointments under the chairmanship of Philip Hampton. David Buik, partner at BGC Partners Hampton's credentials as RBS chairman look exemplary to me: he is formerly chairman of retail giant J Sainsbury, finance director of BG Group and holds board positions at Lloyds Bank and BG Group. If ever a person is qualified to make sure the job was being done, then Hampton is as good a candidate as any. He took a personal decision at the weekend to waive his own bonus -- but that probably did not help Hester's cause. There is very little correlation between the role and the remuneration of a chairman and a CEO. A chairman's job is to make sure that the board's policy is complied with: the CEO's job is to form that policy and execute it. The fact remains that political expediency and public opinion in the UK have bullied Hester into waiving his justified bonus. There is no doubt that opposition Labour lawmakers and the Lib-Dems, the minority party in the ruling UK coalition government, would have won any parliamentary vote ordering the rescinding of Hester's board-approved emolument. Such a vote may not have necessitated RBS to change its mind about Hester's bonus but it would have made his position untenable. Hester's job at RBS during the past three years has not been made any easier by the incompetence of EU politicians, whose inept and moribund approach to the sovereign debt crisis has trashed the banking sector's value. This level of incompetence has taken the EU and the UK to the brink of recession. What bank in its right mind would lend money to counterparties, which may not be able to repay Many, like me, think Hester has done a very good job. The bank will be in profit this year 2011 for maybe £2 billion against a loss of £1.6 billion last year and a gargantuan loss of £26 billion in 2009. The balance sheet under his stewardship has been cut from £2.2 trillion by circa £700 billion. The investment banking division is being wound down. Corporate broker Hoare Govett may be sold to Jeffries of the U.S. this week to include only about 50 people. Bonuses will drop substantially at RBS next year. Yes, there will be a furore over the bonuses due to John Hourican of ABN/AMRO and Ellen Alenamy of Citizens Bank, who are both owned by RBS -- but that has little to do with a CEO's compensation package. I hope that Hester does not resign -- but frankly he has grounds to. The support of his political masters looks very flaky. The job is immensely stressful. Does he need the grief if the support is not there Frankly, the office of CEO has been rubbished by the unparalleled pressure heaped on Hester by UK politicians, who understandably pander to public opinion. It is such a shame that Hester's case has not been objectively presented. It is quite unfair that his bonus should be used as the yardstick for investment banking bonus culture as Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, would have us believe. The £1.2 million salary is cast in stone: Hester needs to keep a team of the best people incentivized so that the taxpayer gets its £45 billion returned pretty damn quick. The bonuses awarded to Hester are only meaningful if RBS's share price rises, resulting in the UK taxpayer being repaid. That strikes me as pragmatic and sensible. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Buik.</text>

<title>CNN.com - The suicide of capitalism - Jul 18, 2006</title>
<text>Molly Ivins is a nationally syndicated columnist. The suicide of capitalism Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Washington Manage Alerts | What Is This AUSTIN, Texas CREATORS -- In case you haven't got anything else to worry about -- like war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming or Apocalypse Now -- how about the suicide of capitalism Late last month, the U.S. Court of Appeals struck down a new rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mandatory registration with the SEC for most hedge funds. This may not strike you as the end of the world, but that's because you've either forgotten what a hedge fund is or how much trouble they can get us into. These investment pools for rich folks are now a $1.2 trillion industry known to insiders, I am pleased to report, as "the hedge fund community". Hedge funds are now beginning to be used by average investors and pension investors. Back in 1998, there was this little-bitty old hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management. Because hedge funds make high-risk bets, Long Term Capital got itself in so much trouble its collapse actually threatened to wreck world markets, and regulators had to step in to negotiate a $3.6 billion bailout. A similar fiasco at this point probably would break world markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission under William Donaldson appointed after the Enron mess had tried to regulate hedge funds. But Christopher Cox, current SEC chairman and no friend of regulation, said he would consult other members of the administration about whether to appeal the ruling, which "came on the same day as disclosures," reports The Washington Post, that the feds "are investigating Pequot Capital Management, Inc., a $7 billion hedge fund, for possible insider trading." Nice timing, judges. This is the third time in less than a year the appeals court has blocked the SEC from acting beyond its authority. According to The Washington Post, "Former SEC member Harvey J. Goldschmid, who voted to approve the plan, yesterday urged regulators to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, members of Congress or both. In the Pequot case, a former SEC lawyer who worked on the Pequot investigation before being fired by the agency has written a letter to key members of the Senate banking and finance committees alleging that the SEC dropped the probe because of political pressure." The lawyer said he was prevented by political pressure from interviewing a top Wall Street executive: Sources said the executive was John J. Mack, once chairman of Pequot and now chief executive of Morgan Stanley -- and a major fundraiser for President Bush's campaigns. I'd say the guy's wired. So what we have here is yet another case of ideological decision-making "all government regulation is bad" being applied despite the most obvious promptings of common sense. Come to think of it, that's exactly the same pattern this administration has followed with war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming and Apocalypse Now. Well, if the administration won't do something, how about Congress Reps. Barney Frank, Michael Capuano and Paul Kanjorski are co-sponsoring a bill to reverse the court decision -- and to gather more information about how hedge funds affect the economy.

<sentence cont= 1>The suicide of capitalism Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Washington Manage Alerts | What Is This AUSTIN, Texas CREATORS -- In case you haven't got anything else to worry about -- like war in the Middle East, nuclear showdowns, global warming or Apocalypse Now -- how about the suicide of capitalism Late last month, the U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Court of Appeals struck down a new rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring mandatory registration with the SEC for most hedge funds.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>This may not strike you as the end of the world, but that's because you've either forgotten what a hedge fund is or how much trouble they can get us into.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >These investment pools for rich folks are now a $1.2 trillion industry known to insiders, I am pleased to report, as "the hedge fund community".</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Hedge funds are now beginning to be used by average investors and pension investors.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Back in 1998, there was this little-bitty old hedge fund called Long Term Capital Management.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Because hedge funds make high-risk bets, Long Term Capital got itself in so much trouble its collapse actually threatened to wreck world markets, and regulators had to step in to negotiate a $3.6 billion bailout.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >A similar fiasco at this point probably would break world markets.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Securities and Exchange Commission under William Donaldson appointed after the Enron mess had tried to regulate hedge funds.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>But Christopher Cox, current SEC chairman and no friend of regulation, said he would consult other members of the administration about whether to appeal the ruling, which "came on the same day as disclosures," reports The Washington Post, that the feds "are investigating Pequot Capital Management, Inc., a $7 billion hedge fund, for possible insider trading." Nice timing, judges.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >This is the third time in less than a year the appeals court has blocked the SEC from acting beyond its authority.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >According to The Washington Post, "Former SEC member Harvey J.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Goldschmid, who voted to approve the plan, yesterday urged regulators to appeal to the U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Supreme Court, members of Congress or both.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>In the Pequot case, a former SEC lawyer who worked on the Pequot investigation before being fired by the agency has written a letter to key members of the Senate banking and finance committees alleging that the SEC dropped the probe because of political pressure."

<sentence cont=0 >Mack, once chairman of Pequot and now chief executive of Morgan Stanley -- and a major fundraiser for President Bush's campaigns.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>I'd say the guy's wired.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >So what we have here is yet another case of ideological decision-making "all government regulation is bad" being applied despite the most obvious promptings of common sense.</sentence>

<text>Researchers to animal-rights activists: We're not afraid Story Highlights 3 research scientists assail animal-rights activists for threats, acts of violence Researchers say their cars and homes have been firebombed They describe the threats, acts of violence as a form of terrorism Spokesman for rights group counters the researchers are terrorizing animals By Thomas G. Watkins CNN CNN -- Three research scientists have taken a rare public stand against animal-rights activists, describing them as terrorists for their threats and acts of violence in commentaries published in the latest issue of The Journal of Neuroscience. Three researchers say they are going to stand up against animal-rights activists who use extreme tactics. Since 2003, "we have seen our cars and homes firebombed or flooded, and we have received letters packed with poisoned razors and death threats via e-mail and voice mail," wrote Dario L. Ringach, a professor of neurobiology and psychology, and J. David Jentsch, a professor of psychology. They work at the University of California, Los Angeles. "Adding insult to injury, misguided animal-rights militants openly incite others to violence on the Internet, brag about the resulting crimes, and go as far as to call plots for our assassination 'morally justifiable,' " they wrote. In telephone interviews with CNN, both men said they had been subject to harassment, threats and violence. Last March, "they blew up my car while it was parked in front of my home at 4 a.m.," said Jentsch, who uses rodents and nonhuman primates in his research into how brain chemistry influences mental disorders. His 2006 Volvo was destroyed. The Animal Liberation Brigade, which took responsibility for the attack in a Web site posting, announced "when we come back, it's not going to be the car, hint, hint," Jentsch said. He said an FBI investigator described the incendiary device as "sophisticated." "We have to take them on directly" The practice long followed by many researchers of keeping quiet and hoping the activists will go away does not work, said the 37-year-old scientist. "We have to take them on directly; that's what we plan to do ... I'm not going to be afraid of these people; they're thugs." Jentsch said the university has provided him with round-the-clock security, along with a handful of other researchers who have been threatened. He acknowledged that having no children may make such a stand easier to take. "People ask me all the time: 'What should people who have children do' " he said. "My only answer is -- what a horrible position to put someone in where they have to choose between their family and their career, their desire to make the world a better place through their science." That was the decision faced by Ringach, who previously worked with primates. Three years ago, when his 6-year-old and 2-year-old children were asleep, 30 to 40 masked activists arrived at their house and banged on the doors and windows, he said. "I just called 911," he said. "I really was terrified; my kids were clinging to my wife." Ringach gave up his work with animals. Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act of 2006 As a result of that incident, Congress passed the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act of 2006. It's a federal law that prohibits interference with animal enterprises, including research. But it is being challenged as unconstitutional and, "so far, I'm not sure it has had an effect on their activities," Ringach said. The activists have not limited their attacks to primate researchers. Last year, at the University of California at Santa Cruz, a researcher who works with mice was awakened at dawn with his wife and their two children when their house was firebombed. They escaped. That day, another researcher at the same school -- who works with flies and has not been identified publicly -- had his car set afire, said Ringach. "They're really against all types of research," Ringach said. The Foundation for Biomedical Research said it was aware of 317 incidents of extremist activity by animal rights activists from 1997 to 2008, including firebombings of researchers' homes and cars, breaking and entering, vandalism, stealing property and acts of intimidation. Scientists bear part of the responsibility for not having explained to the public why their work is important, Ringach said. "I would really like to have an honest and civil debate about animal research," he said. "The problem is it's very difficult to do when every day I have to look under my car and see if something is there." Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, noted that rewards of up to $115,000 have been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the bombings. She said law enforcement officials consider the attacks to be acts of domestic terrorism. Taking it to the next level Dr. Jerry Vlasak, a surgeon and spokesman for the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, an animal-rights group, said it is the researchers who are the terrorists. "They take these sentient and intelligent beings and lock them up in sealed cages ... and eventually kill them and chop them up in little pieces." Asked whether he supports the use of violence in furthering his goals, he likened his mission to those of anti-apartheid and civil rights activists. "I understand why they're willing to do things like that when all attempts at public discourse and reason and discussion have been quashed," he said. "I understand why people would take it to the next level." In a separate commentary in The Journal of Neuroscience, the Society for Neuroscience's outgoing chairman of the Committee on Animals in Research, Jeffrey H. Kordower, called for the National Institutes of Health to ensure the safety of researchers against animal-rights activists. The federal government requires recipients of NIH grants, primarily universities, to have plans to protect patients undergoing clinical trials and to protect animals used in research. But there is no plan to protect researchers, he said in a telephone interview. The request "has fallen on deaf ears," said Kordower, a neurologist who directs the Research Center for Brain Repair at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. Though no one has been hurt, "the ... potential is that someone will be hurt in the near future," he said. Dr. Sally Rockey, acting NIH deputy director for extramural research, defended her organization's efforts. "As we have previously stated, the NIH is extremely concerned about acts of domestic terrorism against biomedical researchers," she said in a written statement. "In collaboration with the biomedical community, we have developed resources to help our grantee institutions prepare for and manage crises. NIH will continue its commitment to this policy in the interests of the safety of the researchers whose work it supports." The issue is a critical one if science is to advance, said Society for Neuroscience President Thomas J. Carew. "Responsible animal research has played a vital role in nearly every major medical advance of the last century, from heart disease to polio, and is essential for future advances as well," he said in a written statement. "Today, it is unacceptable that, in the pursuit of better health and understanding of disease, researchers, their families and their communities face violence and intimidation by extremists." Charges and countercharges Vlasak said he had submitted a letter to the editor to The Journal of Neuroscience that said, "As unfortunate as it may be, all successful liberation struggles have had to incorporate the use of force in addition to rational and educated argument; after all, an oppressor never gives up his power until left with no alternative." Vlasak said Journal editor John Maunsell rejected the letter, telling Vlasak in an e-mail, "We will not publish responses from commentators that appear to condone or encourage violence." That sparked this missive from Vlasak back to Maunsell: "David Jentsch can torture and kill nonhuman primates year after year in his laboratory to allegedly study human addiction, but I refer to the historical use of force to overthrow oppression and you censor my letter "You wallow in hypocrisy, and refuse to acknowledge the suffering of any being besides those of your own species. Your attitudes and behavior will ensure the struggle continues, and hopefully escalates to encompass ever-more effective strategies." Vlasak provided CNN with copies of his e-mail correspondence with Maunsell. A spokeswoman for the journal said it does not comment on potential submissions. In a joint comment e-mailed to CNN, Jentsch and Ringach said, "It is not acceptable for Dr. Vlasak to talk about civilized public discourse out of one side of his mouth and describe violence against us as just and reasonable out of the other. "People like him have deceived the public about the nature and benefits of biomedical research and, at the same time, we think his behavior has hindered the work of legitimate animal rights/welfare groups. "It is critical that 'mainstream' groups sever their ties with violent individuals within their movement and publicly repudiate the acts of animal-right extremists and those that incite them from the sidelines. When that happens, scientists and animal advocates can get together to have a reasoned and civilized dialogue about these important issues." The outspoken researchers are not alone. More than 10,000 people -- many of them scientists -- have signed a "Pro-Test Petition" that credits animal research with having "contributed ... to major advances in the length and quality of our lives." It adds that "violence, intimidation and harassment of scientists and others involved in animal research is neither a legitimate means of protest, nor morally justified."</text>

<title>CNN.com - Group blasts PETA 'Holocaust' project - Feb. 28, 2003</title>
<text>Group blasts PETA 'Holocaust' project Story Tools PETA's comparison of the Nazi Holocaust to the slaughter of animals for food is: An effective argument for animal rights An unfair and outrageous comparison VIEW RESULTS CNN -- The Anti-Defamation League has denounced a campaign by an animal rights group that compares slaughtering animals to the murder of 6 million Jews in World War II. The graphic campaign and exhibit "Holocaust on Your Plate," devised by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, juxtaposes 60-square-foot panels displaying gruesome scenes from Nazi death camps side by side with disturbing photographs from factory farms and slaughterhouses. One shows a starving man in a concentration camp next to a starving cow. The exhibit opens Friday in San Diego, California, and went up Thursday at the University of California at Los Angeles. It also is posted on a PETA Web site, www.masskilling.com, which calls for support for the campaign from the Jewish community. The comparisons prompted an angry statement from Abraham Foxman, Anti-Defamation League national director and a Holocaust survivor. "The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate, systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent," the statement said. "PETA's effort to seek approval for their 'Holocaust on Your Plate' campaign is outrageous, offensive and takes chutzpah to new heights." Lisa Lange, PETA's vice president of communications, told CNN's "American Morning With Paula Zahn" on Friday that the idea for the public relations effort came from the late Nobel Prize-winning author Isaac Bashevis Singer, who, she said, wrote: "In relation to them [animals], all people are Nazis; for them it is an eternal Treblinka" -- a death camp in Poland. Lange said the campaign is appropriate because "Nazi concentration camps were modeled after slaughterhouses." The Singer quote, which the group draws upon in its literature as well, was not spoken directly by him but rather comes from his novel "Enemies: A Love Story," when the main character muses on the plight of animals. Singer was a vegetarian who believed strongly in animal rights. "It's shocking, it's startling, it's very hard to look at," Lange said of the exhibit. "We're attacking the mind-set" that condones the slaughter of animals. "The very same mind-set that made the Holocaust possible -- that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' -- is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day," PETA representative Mark Prescott wrote in a statement, which added that members of Prescott's family were murdered by Nazis. The Anti-Defamation League statement, however, counters that "abusive treatment of animals should be opposed, but cannot and must not be compared to the Holocaust." Story Tools</text>

<title>ASIANOW - TIME Asia | India: Is Nothing Sacred? | 5/29/2000</title>
<text>INDIA: Holy Cow! Animal-rights activists expose the barbaric transport and slaughter of the country's most revered beasts The campaign against the practice is attracting support from a number of animal-activist celebrities. Paul McCartney, Brigitte Bardot, Steven Seagal and Nina Hagen took part in an international day of protest two weeks ago in their home countries. "My heart breaks for the misery endured by all the mother cows and their calves ... who have become throw-aways in today's India," McCartney declared. The $1.6 billion Indian leather export industry is feeling the pinch. Gap and its subsidiaries Banana Republic and Old Navy have banned the use of Indian leather in their garments. The British shoe company Clark's announced last week that it will review the purchase of products made from Indian leather. PETA's hit list also includes Florsheim, Nordstrom, Casual Corner and other retail chains. "It's a wake-up call to India's leather industry," says PETA's Indian campaign coordinator Jason Baker. "If it doesn't do something soon to stop the cruelty against cows, there will be no leather industry left." India's leather barons are worried that the protests will cripple exports to the West. Nearly 4,000 tanneries and leather-goods factories depend on the export trade. The industry employs around 1.7 million people, nearly a third of whom are women. "The campaign is going to affect us, no doubt about it," says Mohammed Hashim, chairman of the Council for Leather Exports. He feels his tribe is unfairly targeted. "We're only scavengers," he says. "We take skins sold by slaughter houses." Moreover, he adds, 90% of the hides council members use are from buffalo, goats or sheep. His organization has appealed to exporters to use only leather from animals that have been killed humanely. The government, though, shows no sign of moving against the illegal transport and slaughter. Before PETA's campaign, Indian animal-rights groups had been trying for years to stop the brutal cattle trail. It's a multimillion-dollar business, and the kickbacks to politicians and officials are thought to be huge. The cow "death trains" are operated by the state-owned railway. Banning cow slaughter in West Bengal and Kerala probably wouldn't help, as it would surely lead to an increase in the number of illegal, backstreet slaughter houses. New Delhi may simply find it easier to respond to other demands by animal lovers, like creating a national authority for protecting cows or introducing tougher penalties for cruelty to animals under existing law, the fine is only about $1. A simpler solution would be to lift the ban on cow slaughter throughout India, to deter the deadly, illegal herdings across state lines. "Villagers can't afford to keep unproductive cows. They're not saints," says Bangalore animal-welfare worker Suparna Baksi-Ganguly. "Slaughter has to be made more accessible--suppressing it causes greater misery to the animals." But such a step would provoke the ire of cow lovers, and no political party is likely to risk that. So in a land that venerates them, cows will continue to pay a high price for their holiness.

<title>An animal lover's Olympic nightmare - CNN.com</title>
<text>An animal lover's Olympic nightmare Story Highlights Clamp down on stray cats and animals in China's capital leading up to Olympics Qin Xiaona runs organization to help protect Beijing's estimated 200,000 stray cats Animal welfare still generally seen as 'alternative' idea, but 600 support Qin's group By Steven Jiang For CNN "Beijing Journal" is an occasional series examining China's capital as it prepares for the 2008 Summer Games. BEIJING, China CNN -- Qin Xiaona used to visit the suburban Xiaotangshan Sanatorium in the summer to escape the scorching temperature in the city. Now she comes here to turn up the heat on a subject close to her heart. Animal rights advocate Qin Xiaona mixes leftovers to feed stray cats. "This is our experiment to save the city's stray cats," said the 62-year-old retired TV journalist, as she carried two plastic containers full of leftovers out of her villa surrounded by lush greenery. Calling out a dozen snoozing cats by the bushes, Qin watched them rush over and devour the rice mixed with pork and fish. Qin, who heads the Capital Animal Welfare Association, estimates there are some 200,000 stray cats in Beijing, after her group spent more than two years studying the population. She detailed the precarious state of the felines in an 80,000-word report and decided to start her rescue mission with the 72 cats roaming the sanatorium's sprawling ground. "The health bureau runs this place and agreed to let us take care of the cats," Qin said, lifting up a female kitten to check the healing of the surgery wound on its stomach. "We have already neutered and vaccinated a third of them." "We convinced the health officials that stray cats could be a more effective and environmentally friendly way of rodent control than placing 15 tons of rat poisons across the city every year," she explained. This is the kind of win-win solution that Qin hopes to replicate throughout the capital, where stray animals are frequently culled by the government on fears of spreading diseases or attacking humans. For Qin and other members of her NGO, saving stray cats is just one uphill battle in their war against animal cruelty in a culture that often treats man's four-legged friends with little favor. For over 15 years and with meager funding, they have been setting up shelters to house abandoned pets, persuading restaurants to take dog meat off the menus and, most importantly, lobbying legislators to pass an animal welfare law -- a goal that nevertheless remains distant. "Many in the government and society still consider us peripheral and alternative -- and don't recognize and approve our work," Qin said. When Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics seven years ago, she and fellow activists perceived a perfect catalyst in expanding animal rights. To their dismay, the authorities have since stepped up their campaigns against animals -- pets and strays alike -- aimed at "cleaning up" the city for the Games. In 2006 Beijing implemented a controversial "one family, one dog" rule for urban households and required such pet dogs no taller than 35 centimeters 14 inches. Don't Miss Beijing journal:  The series "It is such a ridiculous law," Qin raised her voice, still livid. "Anyone with a little understanding of animals would know that the temperament of dogs has nothing to do with their size, but depends on their breed and training." Although official policies are difficult to modify, Qin feels her efforts have slowly changed the minds of many ordinary citizens. "People's attitude toward animals reflects their attitude toward fellow human beings," she offered. "We should promote love, not hatred, from an early age on." Qin has seen more young people grow receptive to the concept of animal welfare and now also counts some unlikely volunteers -- including a former policewoman -- among her 600-strong group. With the Olympics around the corner, however, Qin has become jittery amid reports of an intensifying government crackdown on animals. "I feel my heart is in my throat," she admitted. "Many officials get money and quotas for culling -- they simply find it so much easier than caring for animals." As she finished feeding the cats at the sanatorium, Qin received a phone call from an animal lover living in a residential compound near the Olympic district. "They are crying for help for the 30 stray cats there," she said. "They have neutered and vaccinated 90 percent of those cats, but officials still sealed the cats in the basement with cement because of health and safety concerns during the Games." Frantically dialing, Qin tried to reach the right person before time ran out for the felines. "Innocent animals shouldn't have to pay the ultimate price for the Olympics," she said.</text>

<title>Bob Barker touts bill to protect traveling circus animals - CNN.com</title>
<text>Bob Barker touts bill to protect traveling circus animals From Stacey Samuel, CNN updated 11:09 PM EDT, Wed November 2, 2011 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Bob Barker urges passage of the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act In a Capitol Hill news conference, he tells of violence used to train animals Animal protection advocate tells of confined lives of large show animals Actress Jorga Fox: "Our kids look to us to do what is right" Washington CNN -- Bob Barker, the former host of "The Price Is Right," made an impassioned plea Wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment: the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses. At a Capitol Hill news conference, Barker noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks, which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty. "How do they train them They have to dominate the animal," Barker said. "How do they dominate the animal They beat it, with clubs, fists, black jacks, ax handles, golf clubs. They shock it with all sorts of electric devices. They use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks." Barker, who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection, is championing the Traveling Exotic Animal Protection Act. The bill, which would amend the existing Animal Welfare Act, has attracted bipartisan support. The bill would affect only traveling shows. It specifically exempts zoos, aquariums and research labs and rodeos. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Virginia, said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for Americans, "how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation's moral character." Dr. Mel Richardson of Animal Defenders International lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most, if not all, lions, tigers and elephants in traveling shows: "Imagine living all of your life on a queen-size or king-size bed." But the concerns are not confined to their housing. Jan Creamer, president of ADI, said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment. Barker's celebrity co-host was actress Jorga Fox of "CSI" and "The West Wing," who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals, and taking them off the road. "Our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun. ... If our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were, I think they'd actually be very disappointed in us, for [going] to these places," Fox said. A recent incident in Ohio in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities, and a recent lawsuit against SeaWorld alleging the exploitation of orcas, have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals. Barker and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation. Similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries, including Bolivia, Peru, Portugal and India. And, according to the panel, more than a half-dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit. "It is time for the United States to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing," Barker said.</text>

<title>Animal rights activists, UCLA researchers square off at protest - CNN.com</title>
<text>Animal rights activists, UCLA researchers square off at protest Story Highlights Dr. David Jentsch joins protest after his car was firebombed last month Activists condemn use of animals as subjects for medical research Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars Jentsch: "This is terror. There is no two ways about it. It's extremism" From Chuck Conder CNN Producer LOS ANGELES, California -- On Earth Day on Wednesday, Dr. David Jentsch marched at the head of a column of UCLA students and faculty members to the chant of, "Stand up for science!" Across the street a smaller but equally vocal group of animal rights advocates chanted, "U-C-L-A, how many animals have you killed today!" Animal rights activists say large numbers of animals are killed each year during medical trials. Until recently, Jentsch had never dreamed he would lead a political demonstration. But Jentsch's life took a sharp turn last month when his car was firebombed in his driveway. A radical group of animal rights activists claimed responsibility for the act. "This is terror," Jentsch said. "There is no two ways about it. It's extremism. It's an attempt to intimidate." It was the latest in a string of arson attacks against UCLA researchers who use animals in medical research projects. Since 2006, there have been seven attacks aimed at researcher's homes or cars. No arrests have been made in the cases, which are being investigated by an FBI lead task force on terrorism. "We believe it's just a matter of time before someone is going to be hurt," said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Salvador Hernandez. "The intent of these groups is to intimidate and coerce." Hernandez heads up the task force investigating the series of attacks and says their actions qualify as terrorist attacks. But animal rights advocate Chris DeRose says nothing could be further from the truth "There has never been one human being in this country being killed or even hurt," he said. He believes the university researchers are the bad guys. "What I do condemn is what goes on behind those walls," he says. DeRose, founder of Last Chance for Animals, says he doesn't condone firebombing researchers' homes, but he doesn't condemn it either. Watch people against animal research at protest » "The reason these people are doing it is because they have been pushed ... nobody is listening ... over a hundred million animals a year are killed in universities and major hospitals in this country," he said. Jentsch argues that same medical research using lab animals has lead to many medical breakthroughs that benefit mankind. UCLA points to research advances in breast cancer treatments, Parkinson's disease and artificial heart technology that relied on experiments involving lab animals at their California facilities. Jentsch's own research involves studies aimed at treating drug addiction in humans. He studies the brains of monkeys that have been injected with methamphetamine. He says his experiments are peer-reviewed and adhere strictly to established rules for the treatment of lab animals. Watch supporters of animal research at protest » Jentsch says that he hopes that this week's dueling demonstrations can lead to a dialogue. He believes many of the protestors voicing opposition to the UCLA labs do not endorse the string of violent acts aimed against him and other researchers, "but it is essential for them to repudiate this type of activity." In the meantime, Jentsch says he refuses to be intimidated. "I'm going to continue to live where I live, continue to educate people about my work," he said. "I'm not going to stop."</text>

<title>Videos renew debate on military use of animals - CNN.com</title>
<text>Videos renew debate on military use of animals Story Highlights Group obtains military videos under Freedom of Information Act Use of animals in military medical training is illegal, group claims Military says regulations followed, alternatives are explored Former medic says training with live animals "definitely" an asset CNN -- Newly released videos are raising questions about the military's continued use of live animals in simulated battlefield medical training. In the military training video, a monkey is monitored after being given a simulated nerve agent. The military training videos were acquired by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine under the Freedom of Information Act. The PCRM claims the videos, which show the use of monkeys and goats in medical training, are evidence that the military is violating its own animal-welfare regulations. Military officials counter that the training is legal and vital to saving the lives of service members in the field. In one of the training videos, a live vervet monkey is anesthetized and then injected with a dose of physostigmine, a simulated nerve agent. The drug simulates some of the effects of a nerve agent, including increased perspiration, muscle spasms and difficulty in breathing. The military says trainees observe the effects of the physostigmine and then take steps to relieve them, injecting the animal with an antidote. The animal's complete recovery takes about 90 minutes, according to the military. "The animals recover completely and display no behavioral or physical ill effects from the exercise," a military spokesman said in an e-mail about the procedure. "No animal has ever died as a result of the exercise." In another video, a medical instructor uses a scalpel to slice open the leg of an anesthetized goat. The video goes on to show medical personnel applying a tourniquet and then dressing the wound. A third video shows a chest tube being inserted into an anesthetized goat. Jamie Campbell, a former U.S. Army medic, says the use of animals in medical training was "most definitely" an asset to him. "It was something you can't experience anywhere else," Campbell told CNN. "As of right now I don't believe there are simulations that can simulate the combat environment," Campbell said. "Patients move, arteries retract, the feel of blood, the feel of muscle, the feel of tissue -- that's something I don't feel a manikin or a video can simulate." Campbell did say, however, that the use of monkeys in simulated nerve-agent exercises might not be necessary. "With this type of scenario, an alternative may be able to be used. You know convulsions. You know vomiting, things that can be acted out ... this is something I think they could find an alternative to." The former medic also said that no amount of training can truly replicate real combat. "Working on an animal -- although it replicates a lot of the injuries -- it can never replicate working on the guy you talked to a half-hour ago. Or working on the person who showed you pictures of his daughter," Campbell said. "But working on the goat trained a lot of medics to save lives, and without that training, how many more casualties would we have had" The PCRM argues that the use of monkeys and goats in the exercises is against military policy and that alternative training methods are available. "Battlefield medics and others caring for our troops should receive state-of-the-art, human-centered training," the PCRM's Hope Ferdowsian said in a news release. "Training with goats and monkeys is inhumane and violates military animal welfare regulations. It also offers an inferior educational experience. "Treating a goat with an artificially created wound is very different from caring for a human casualty," Ferdowsian added. The PCRM, joined by 17 former military doctors and medics, has filed a Petition for Enforcement with the Army surgeon general and other military leaders to halt the practices. The organization says one of the former military doctors calling for a halt to the practices is retired U.S. Navy Capt. Charles Rosciam of the Medical Service Corps. Rosciam served 13 months in combat and treated more than 100 casualties, the PCRM says. Military officials say the use of animals is conducted under strict compliance with animal welfare regulations. "We are dedicated to employing the best available training techniques to prepare our medical care providers to treat battlefield injuries while minimizing the use of live animals," the military spokesman said. "To this end, the Medical Chemical Biological Casualty course makes extensive use of manikins and computer-based training."</text>

<sentence cont=0 >In one of the training videos, a live vervet monkey is anesthetized and then injected with a dose of physostigmine, a simulated nerve agent.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The drug simulates some of the effects of a nerve agent, including increased perspiration, muscle spasms and difficulty in breathing.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The military says trainees observe the effects of the physostigmine and then take steps to relieve them, injecting the animal with an antidote.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The animal's complete recovery takes about 90 minutes, according to the military.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The animals recover completely and display no behavioral or physical ill effects from the exercise," a military spokesman said in an e-mail about the procedure.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"No animal has ever died as a result of the exercise." In another video, a medical instructor uses a scalpel to slice open the leg of an anesthetized goat.</sentence>

<sentence cont=1 >"It was something you can't experience anywhere else," Campbell told CNN.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"As of right now I don't believe there are simulations that can simulate the combat environment," Campbell said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Patients move, arteries retract, the feel of blood, the feel of muscle, the feel of tissue -- that's something I don't feel a manikin or a video can simulate." Campbell did say, however, that the use of monkeys in simulated nerve-agent exercises might not be necessary.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"With this type of scenario, an alternative may be able to be used.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >You know convulsions.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >You know vomiting, things that can be acted out . this is something I think they could find an alternative to." The former medic also said that no amount of training can truly replicate real combat.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Working on an animal -- although it replicates a lot of the injuries -- it can never replicate working on the guy you talked to a half-hour ago.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Or working on the person who showed you pictures of his daughter," Campbell said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"But working on the goat trained a lot of medics to save lives, and without that training, how many more casualties would we have had" The PCRM argues that the use of monkeys and goats in the exercises is against military policy and that alternative training methods are available.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Battlefield medics and others caring for our troops should receive state-of-the-art, human-centered training," the PCRM's Hope Ferdowsian said in a news release.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Training with goats and monkeys is inhumane and violates military animal welfare regulations.</sentence>

<text>Border fence is a dividing line in immigration debate Story Highlights Eight Democrats in Congress wrote Obama to halt building of border fence Border Patrol agents say fence has drastically cut number of border crossings Then-Sen. Obama voted to authorize almost $3 billion for building 670 miles of fence Critic says barrier has forced illegal immigrants to make riskier desert crossings By John King CNN Chief National Correspondent On CNN's "State of the Union," CNN host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. King recently traveled to Arizona, to explore the debate over how to control illegal immigration. A fence separates the United States from Mexico in the U.S. Border Patrol's Yuma Sector in San Luis, Arizona. SAN LUIS, Arizona CNN -- The Yuma desert is below: San Luis, Arizona, to one side and San Luis, Mexico, to the other. On this clear day, the Colorado River is glistening, birds playfully circling over what any map defines as the U.S.-Mexico border in this area. But from a helicopter above, the border is a steel barrier that stands out along the riverbank and against the desert sands, and is the dividing line that gets the most attention from those crying to cross illegally and those who believe recent efforts to bolster U.S. border security have been riddled with wrong choices. Just this past week, eight Democrats in Congress wrote President Obama urging him to halt any further construction of the fence, one of the many border- and immigration -related political debates that have carried over from the Bush administration. To the Border Patrol agents stationed in Yuma Sector, there is no debate. To them, the fence is a success story. From a Vietnam War-vintage Huey helicopter, pilot Chad Smith points across the border to Mexico's Highway 2 and then to the barriers that help stop illegal immigrants from making a sprint into southern Arizona. "You can see the triple-layer fencing," Smith tells us as he lowers the helicopter and hovers over what was once a major crossing point for illegal immigrants and drug smugglers. "Steel fence right on the border, the pedestrian fence about 90 feet north of that, and then the chain-link fence with the barbed wire." 'State of the Union' John King reinvents Sunday talk: More time, for more politics. Sunday, 9 a.m. ET see full schedule » The fence has three layers in areas where there is an urban neighborhood on the Mexican side. Smith is among those who say their flights are less hectic now because while you can still clearly see the trails in the sand and in some hilly areas below, there is considerably less traffic. "I've flown before and come back and had 70-plus [illegal immigrants logged in a tracking book]," Smith said. " I know guys who have gone on a flight and come back with 100-plus illegals in their logbook. Now it is in single digits, typically." It is a fascinating view from above: Old trails in some places, and the remnants of newly placed white sandbags in others. "It forms a pretty good bridge for them to drive across." Smith says of the sandbags. When they are spotted from above, Border Patrol agents on the ground are called in to destroy the makeshift crossings. Congress in 2006 -- with then-Sen. Barack Obama's support -- authorized nearly $3 billion for 670 miles of fencing stretching from California to Texas. There are more lights, sensors and cameras, and there are also more agents like Mike Lowrie driving patrols and chasing tips called in from colleagues monitoring the camera feeds at the Yuma Sector headquarters. Standing alongside the steel barrier at a point in which there is just one layer of fencing, Lowrie shakes his head when told that some in Washington want to stop additional construction in other areas. Don't Miss Recession comes late but hits hard in Peoria "This used to be a very high-trafficked area, and now it is not," Lowrie told us. Asked to define "high traffic," Lowrie says, "In the Yuma Sector, we would get about 800 a day. Now, 25 maybe, or 10." Nodding toward the barrier, he continued: "Numbers don't lie. We didn't have it three years ago, and we were getting massive numbers of illegal entries. We have it now, and we don't." But there are voices on both extremes of the immigration debate that say the role of the fence is exaggerated, or that say the barrier's benefit in slowing illegal traffic is offset by other costs. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose tough stance against illegal immigrants has earned him global media coverage, says the fence is fine, but: "We just arrested 150 in the past 14 days. They're still coming." And Father John Herman, a Roman Catholic priest whose Spanish language Masses are packed with illegal immigrants, blames the fence for more risky crossings in less-populated desert areas. "We know that the way enforcement has gone has driven many people into the desert and caused more deaths. Needless deaths. If we could only get together and work for comprehensive immigration reform."</text>

<title>Opinion: Border security push is a joke - CNN.com</title>
<text>Border security push is a joke By Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor updated 7:38 AM EDT, Fri June 21, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette: Tightened border security won't prevent immigration He says Washington's moves reveal ignorance about 1,969 mile U.S.-Mexico border If people are intent on getting across, they'll find a way, he says Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette . San Diego, California CNN -- When the discussion turns to the U.S.-Mexico border, living less than an hour away has its privileges. I've covered the international boundary from three states California, Arizona and Texas and from every conceivable angle -- including from the air. I once went up in a Border Patrol helicopter that started at the Pacific Ocean and flew east over the fence line. On the Mexican side, homeowners in Tijuana were using the scrap metal wall put up by U.S. taxpayers as their backyard fence. Down the road, groups of young men waited patiently for their chance to cross. What Americans consider an impenetrable barrier, the desperate and determined see as a speed bump on the road to a better life. Ruben Navarrette Jr. I've learned over a quarter-century of writing about immigration from the Southwest to be skeptical about claims that the federal government can fully secure the 1,969-mile U.S.-Mexico border. Don't tell that to Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota. The Republican senators have proposed an amendment to the Senate's "Gang of Eight" immigration bill. It would increase the size of the Border Patrol by 20,000 agents, and complete 700 miles of border fencing. The amendment might get the bill some Republican votes. But it probably won't do much to secure the border. The property line between the two countries goes through everything from deserts to mountains to private ranch land to a university to the Rio Grande. Ever try to build a fence on a river It's not easy. Americans can build walls and fences, triple the number of Border Patrol agents, and deploy SEAL Team 6 if they like. Yet, it won't make much difference. Talk to the experts -- the Border Patrol agents -- and they'll tell you: There is no impediment that a person won't go around, over or under if it means being able to feed his family. Speaking of "under," law enforcement officials say there are likely hundreds of sophisticated drug tunnels all along the U.S.-Mexico border built by drug cartels. The smugglers who used to move illegal drugs have now branched out and smuggle illegal immigrants. There is evidence that they're moving their human cargo through the tunnels -- underneath all the nifty and expensive enforcement tools deployed on the surface. Advocates of border security disagree that the crackdown isn't working. They insist that the fact that the flow of Mexican immigrants into the United States is at a historic low is attributable to the billions of dollars we've spent on everything from border fencing and additional Border Patrol agents to high-tech surveillance equipment. That shows how little they know. There are two major reasons that fewer people are coming, and neither of them originated on the U.S. side of the border. First, there are more opportunities than there have been in recent years to make a decent living in Mexico. And there is a sluggish economy in the United States. So all things being equal, more Mexicans are deciding that migrating to "el norte" isn't worth the hassle. Second, our border crackdowns have been very beneficial to at least one group -- coyote smugglers. Every time we build a mile of fencing or deploy more agents, we make it harder for them to do business, so they raise their prices. A trip across the border that, 10 years ago, cost about $500 now runs as much as $4,000 -- more if you absolutely, positively have to be there overnight. Many Mexicans have sticker shock. Honestly, it makes you wonder if Republicans in Congress are in cahoots with the immigrant smugglers. One is putting money into the pocket of the other. If you want to know why the United States has had such a tough time controlling illegal immigration over the years, there's one reason. What other law enforcement operation can you think of where the harder you crack down, the wealthier and more powerful the bad guys get so they can come back and fight you even harder the next time Here's the elephant in the Congressional caucus room: Americans will never control illegal immigrants until lawmakers -- in both parties -- "man up" and risk angering the businesses that contribute to political campaigns by fining and locking up U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants. And let's not forget one of the biggest offenders, who is somehow never mentioned by the media -- the American household, with its growing dependence on nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, senior care givers and other helpers. Adding to the problem, pro-border security conservatives confuse "securing" the border with "sealing" the border. They say they want to secure the border. But when you hear the details -- i.e., the "100% awareness" rate and "90% apprehension" rate called for by an amendment from Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who is almost certainly going to vote against the Senate bill anyway -- it's clear that what these folks really want is to seal the border. There is a big difference between securing and sealing. The former is feasible; the second is a fantasy. Anyway, I suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the Republican senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse. Conservatives saying that we can't have immigration reform before we secure the U.S.-Mexico border is like liberals saying we can't have more welfare reform until we end poverty. That's never going to happen, and they know it. So we're just playing games. In the meantime, millions of people are stuck in the legal equivalent of suspended animation, and a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix a broken system is being wasted.

<title>Concern over proposed Greek border fence - CNN.com</title>
<text>Concern over proposed Greek border fence By Elinda Labropoulou, For CNN A Greek guard patrols the Greek-Turkey border last month. Greece is building a 12-kilometer wall along the border. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Greece has proposed building a fence along its border with Turkey Humanitarian groups say it will hurt asylum seekers The Greek government says it will help curb illegal immigration RELATED TOPICS Turkey Athens, Greece CNN -- Greece's decision to build a 12-kilometer 7.5-mile fence along its border with Turkey in a bid to curb illegal immigration has caused mixed reactions, with humanitarian agencies saying the fence could prevent asylum seekers from reaching safety. Greek Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis announced the decision, saying "action is necessary" because more than 100,000 people have entered Greece illegally in the past year, and the country "can no longer tolerate such high numbers." The European Union border control agency Frontex has said that in October 2010, an average of 245 people per day crossed into Greece illegally, mostly from the overland crossing with Turkey in northeastern Greece. That's where the proposed fence is to be built. "The fence in question is to act as a preventive measure to curb illegal immigration and will be constructed along the country's only overland border with Turkey," the Public Order Ministry told CNN. The rest of the border between the two countries is a 200-kilometer 124-mile river. Illegal migrants usually cross into Greece on inflatable boats or even on foot in the summer, when the waters are low. The ministry has described the 12-kilometer area for the proposed fence as "a series of country roads with no clear border demarcations." The Communist Party of Greece has criticised the measure as "barbaric," and humanitarian agencies have expressed concern that the fence could prevent asylum seekers and others in need from reaching safety. Kalliopi Stefanaki, the UNHCR protection officer for Greece, has described the fence as a "strong measure" but said every country has the right to guard its own borders. "We agree that Greece in entitled to enhance security at its borders in any way it sees fit," she said. "What we are concerned about is that the rights of those who want to cross this, or any other border, to request protection are protected." The UNHCR has repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey to update their asylum systems. "We believe there is a lot of room for improvement on this issue," said Stefanaki. "Greece is not meeting international standards regarding its asylum system." Commenting on the fence proposal, the European Commission said it would be a "short-term measure" that does not address the heart of the problem. The EU has instead asked for structural measures to discourage traffickers and smugglers. Official figures show that currently about 90% of migrants who illegally enter the European Union do so through Greece. "The idea of building more walls around a Fortress Europe is outdated," said Daniel Esdras, the head of the Greek office for the International Organization for Migration. He also called for more international cooperation in addressing the issue. "These are not just Greece's borders, but also those of the European Union," Esdras said. "And people will carry on trying to reach a better life unless conditions in their home countries are improved. This is something governments should together be focusing on." A timeline for the creation of the fence has not been given. The Public Order Ministry says the proposal is still at an initial stage. Share this on:</text>

<sentence cont=0 >Greek Public Order Minister Christos Papoutsis announced the decision, saying "action is necessary" because more than 100,000 people have entered Greece illegally in the past year, and the country "can no longer tolerate such high numbers." The European Union border control agency Frontex has said that in October 2010, an average of 245 people per day crossed into Greece illegally, mostly from the overland crossing with Turkey in northeastern Greece.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >That's where the proposed fence is to be built.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The fence in question is to act as a preventive measure to curb illegal immigration and will be constructed along the country's only overland border with Turkey," the Public Order Ministry told CNN.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The rest of the border between the two countries is a 200-kilometer 124-mile river.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Illegal migrants usually cross into Greece on inflatable boats or even on foot in the summer, when the waters are low.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The ministry has described the 12-kilometer area for the proposed fence as "a series of country roads with no clear border demarcations." The Communist Party of Greece has criticised the measure as "barbaric," and humanitarian agencies have expressed concern that the fence could prevent asylum seekers and others in need from reaching safety.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Kalliopi Stefanaki, the UNHCR protection officer for Greece, has described the fence as a "strong measure" but said every country has the right to guard its own borders.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We agree that Greece in entitled to enhance security at its borders in any way it sees fit," she said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"What we are concerned about is that the rights of those who want to cross this, or any other border, to request protection are protected." The UNHCR has repeatedly urged Greece and Turkey to update their asylum systems.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We believe there is a lot of room for improvement on this issue," said Stefanaki.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Greece is not meeting international standards regarding its asylum system." Commenting on the fence proposal, the European Commission said it would be a "short-term measure" that does not address the heart of the problem.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The EU has instead asked for structural measures to discourage traffickers and smugglers.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Official figures show that currently about 90% of migrants who illegally enter the European Union do so through Greece.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The idea of building more walls around a Fortress Europe is outdated," said Daniel Esdras, the head of the Greek office for the International Organization for Migration.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >He also called for more international cooperation in addressing the issue.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"These are not just Greece's borders, but also those of the European Union," Esdras said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"And people will carry on trying to reach a better life unless conditions in their home countries are improved.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >This is something governments should together be focusing on." A timeline for the creation of the fence has not been given.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Public Order Ministry says the proposal is still at an initial stage.</sentence>

<title>Fence that fell brought Arabs together -- briefly - CNN.com</title>
<text>Gazans find Egypt's border door shutting I don't know if they ever made it to Cairo, since Egyptian security forces weren't letting Gazans go beyond the town of Al-'Arish, 40 kilometers west of Rafah. For them, borders are an obstacle. Most people I spoke with were thrilled with the open borders. "We need food and fuel and medicine, everything," one man told me. "And the Egyptians need our business. This is how this should be. We need them; they need us." "We are one people in two countries," another told me. "We should be one country." Not everyone was pondering lofty ideals. "I need to get to Cairo," a Gazan who had an American passport told me. "I haven't had a beer in five years." Egyptians -- identifiable by their unique accents -- mixed easily with the hard-bitten, toughened Gazans, one and all caught up in a frenzy of buying and selling, at the same time reveling in the revolution. Of course, there were moments of tension -- for example when the Egyptian border guards temporarily stopped Gazans from entering Egypt. Rocks were thrown in both directions, curses hurled with equal gusto. But when the Egyptians relented and stepped aside again, it was all handshakes and hardy greetings, shouts of thanks to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak for allowing the border to stay open. We even saw roses being passed to the Egyptian border guards. There are so many dimensions to what happened on the border that it's hard to list them all. The Gazan "breakout" has been good for Hamas, which controls this narrow, poverty-stricken strip of land. It's won praise from Palestinians across the political spectrum. Pro-western Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had publicly appealed to Israel to ease the blockade of Gaza, only to have those appeals bruskly brushed aside. Many Gazans we spoke to believe Hamas also took advantage of the open border to bring in weapons, although Hamas strenuously denies that. The collapse of the border -- if only for a few days -- also calls into question Israel's efforts to squeeze Hamas, which was based on the belief that restricting the flow of fuel and goods to Gaza would create public pressure on Hamas to stop rocket fire from Gaza into Israel. And it's a reminder to Washington that its drive for a Middle East peace deal is all the more difficult without Hamas. Last year the United States backed Abbas and his security forces, only to see them swiftly defeated by Hamas in Gaza. Washington tacitly backed the Israeli blockade on Gaza, and now that has collapsed. The tentative hopes raised by the Annapolis Mideast summit last November and by President Bush's visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, during which he reiterated his determination to work out a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, risk being overtaken by events. Events in Gaza also put President Mubarak of Egypt in a quandary. On the one hand, the United States -- the source of more than $2 billion in economic and military aid -- and Israel wanted a swift closure of the border. On the other, many Egyptians, including the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, were agitating with ever greater voice that Egypt come to the rescue of the people of Gaza. The situation on the border with Egypt won't go on for much longer. Monday morning, we watched as Egyptian troops unrolled loops of barbed wire in front of the low cement wall that marks the Egyptian side of No Man's Land. Gradually the situation is coming under control. But a precedent has been set. For a few days at least, the man-made frontier separating Egypt and Gaza disappeared and what took its place seemed natural to people on both sides. But the brief fall of the Gaza border may cause a shudder along other frontiers that divide Arab from Arab. E-mail to a friend</text>

<title>Hundreds of Syrian refugees cross into Turkey - CNN.com</title>
<text>Hundreds of Syrian refugees cross into Turkey From Ivan Watson and Yesim Comert, CNN Hundreds flee Syria Syrian refugees fleeing violence sit on the border with Turkey Refugees from Jisr Al-Shugur says tens of thousands have fled More than 400 Syrian refugees crossed in the past day into Turkey, news agency says Guvecci, Turkey CNN -- About 100 Syrian refugees clustered Wednesday, chanting and holding a Syrian flag, next to a border fence with Turkey, watched closely by several Turkish soldiers pacing in front of them. During the course of the day, more than 400 others crossed into Turkish territory near the village of Karbeyaz, even though this is not an official border gate, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said. They were housed in a tent city near Yayladagi, along the border, where nearly 700 people were sheltered in 100 tents, the agency said. Many of the refugees are from the Syrian border town of Jisr Al-Shugur, from which they say tens of thousands of residents have fled over the past week after scores of people were killed in fighting. Syrian refugees flee into Turkey Residents fear military wrath in Syria Clashes increase along Syrian border RELATED TOPICS Protests and Demonstrations The Syrian government said more than 80 security forces were killed in an ambush by "armed groups" in Jisr Al-Shugur. But residents of the town say those people died after fighting broke out among Syrian soldiers, some of whom mutinied after Syrian troops fired on anti-government demonstrators at the funeral of a slain protester. "My friend was shot next to me when we were at a funeral for a martyr," said one Syrian refugee, speaking by telephone to CNN from a stand of trees on the Syrian side of the hilly border area. "There is no milk for children, no water" in Jisr Al-Shugur, he said. "They poisoned the water and there is no more bread." The refugee, who asked not to be identified, said he did not plan to flee into Turkey unless Syrian troops threatened him and his family at this makeshift frontier haven. Activist Fadi Mustafa Soufi, speaking via Skype with CNN from the cluster of refugees along the frontier, said shortly after noon that two women wounded in fighting in Jisr Al-Shugur had arrived in a vehicle. "One woman was shot in the face, but she's not dead yet," Soufi said. Several dozen soldiers who had defected and changed into civilian clothes were among the refugees, Soufi said. On Tuesday night, a refugee woman named Um Ahmed told CNN she had fled to the border with her daughters to escape what she expected would be a Syrian government attack on Jisr Al-Shugur. A growing number of Syrian refugees have fled to Turkey over the past month and a half, raising the possibility of a refugee exodus. In late April, about 250 Syrian civilians fled across the border to the Turkish village of Guvecci. There, they have been housed in tents and fed by the Turkish Red Crescent at an old tobacco factory. Turkish authorities have denied journalists permission to speak with the refugees and have refused to allow the refugees to leave the compound. Turkish officials speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN that 41 Syrians -- several of them wounded -- crossed the border Saturday. A doctor, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that more than 30 Syrians with gunshot and shrapnel wounds had been treated at a hospital in Turkey in recent days. Meanwhile, Soufi, the activist from Jisr Al-Shugur, said he saw the bodies of two wounded Syrian men who died while being driven to the Turkish border. In the past, the Turkish government has made a show of evacuating wounded civilians from Iraq and Libya. But Ankara has taken a different approach with dozens of wounded civilians fleeing Syria. Turkey fears a repeat of the 1991 exodus of large numbers of Kurdish refugees from Northern Iraq. Ankara has also spent the past decade promoting cozy relations and lucrative economic ties with Syria's 45-year-old president, Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations reports more than 1,000 people have been killed during anti-regime protests in Syria in less than three months. Over the past month, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has begun calling for reform in Damascus in a bid to curb the escalating violence. "It is out of the question that we close the border at this point. The developments in Syria are saddening. We are watching in worry," Erdogan said Wednesday. "We hope that Syria changes its attitude towards the civilians to a more tolerant one and realizes its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians." Erdogan has been furiously campaigning ahead of Turkish parliamentary elections scheduled to take place on June 12. Journalist Rasha Qass Yousef contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

<title>'Bargain' aims to deal with border, then guest workers - CNN.com</title>
<text>'Bargain' aims to deal with border, then guest workers Story Highlights • GOP senator calls agreement reached between parties a "grand bargain" • Border security, citizenship, guest workers will be crux of next week's debate • Bipartisan group working to hammer out differences in last year's failed legislation • House speaker says she wants strong GOP support guaranteed before any vote Adjust font size: WASHINGTON CNN -- Senators may have mended fences on contentious immigration legislation that sputtered in Congress last year, and they will head into next week's debate with what one GOP senator called a "grand bargain." However, it's unclear if lawmakers will pick up where they left off, or if they plan to start anew. Senators from both parties have hammered out an outline for a bill and "have come to an agreement on what we have called a, quote, 'grand bargain,' " Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pennsylvania, said from the Senate floor Tuesday. Speaking at a Wednesday news conference, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, urged President Bush to join the bipartisan group of senators in ushering a bill through the legislative process. "The president has got to be personally involved," Leahy said. "You cannot just send up Cabinet members and ask them to speak with a few members of the president's party and think that's going to get you through. You cannot issue great-sounding press releases on a take-it-or-leave-it basis." Leahy said he believes the president is committed to solving the nation's immigration woes, "but this won't work unless he comes in and talks to both Republicans and Democrats and makes it very clear that he is behind our efforts." Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has set a Monday deadline for beginning debate on the issue, but he has not indicated whether senators would discuss the old bill or a new one. "One of those two things I will bring to the Senate floor, and that will be the working document that we will work from," Reid said Tuesday. Bush and Democratic leaders have generally concurred on immigration, much to the chagrin of Bush's conservative base, which helped shoot down last year's legislation in the GOP-controlled Congress. Last year's bill stalled because of its reliance on Bush's proposed temporary guest-worker program and a clause paving a road to citizenship for the millions of immigrants already in the United States illegally. GOP critics in the House of Representatives fiercely opposed the proposals, saying they amounted to "amnesty." The Senate bill never meshed with a GOP-skippered House proposal that focused primarily on border enforcement, and the prospect of an immigration overhaul ultimately died. Congressional sources said earlier this month that a bipartisan group of legislators was working to reconcile the proposals, and it hasn't come easy. Full story Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-authored the plan that stalled last year, said as much this month. Added GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson of Georgia: "All of the meetings I've been in are very intense because this is the No. 1 domestic issue in the country and passions run deeply on all sides." Weeks of negotiations have focused on a compromise that would OK citizenship and a guest-worker program only after the White House showed progress in securing the nation's borders and enforcing already-existing immigration laws, sources said. "We are talking about triggers," Specter said, "so that we don't move ahead to dealing with the 11 million undocumented immigrants or dealing with a temporary-worker program until we have solved the problem of securing the border and providing for identification so that there is a basis for using tough sanctions on the employers." To enforce such sanctions, Specter said, you have to give employers "a fair opportunity to know who is legal and who is illegal." The measure under consideration would double the number of Border Patrol agents to 12,000 and would include "very strong employer sanctions," Specter said. While Democrats and Republicans seem to be reaching an agreement in the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said she wants to see strong GOP support for an immigration bill before it hits the House hopper. She reportedly has told the White House that no immigration bill will make it to the House floor unless Bush can guarantee at least 70 Republican ayes. The ultimatum is aimed at ensuring the bill is labeled bipartisan, thereby making it difficult for Republicans to use the legislation against Democrats in the 2008 elections, a Democratic source said. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report. Tools:</text>

<title>CNN.com - Bush pushes immigration plan on border visit - May 18, 2006</title>
<text>Bush pushes immigration plan on border visit U.S. President George W. Bush tours the US-Mexico border at San Luis, Arizona, Thursday. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Manage Alerts | What Is This WASHINGTON CNN -- President George W. Bush visited the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday to try to build support for his plan to stem the tide of illegal immigrants into the United States. In an interview with CNN White House Correspondent Suzanne Malveaux, Bush was asked how he can convince his opponents -- including many in his own Republican party -- that his plan is sound. "I can offer them a comprehensive strategy to get the job done," Bush said in San Luis, Arizona, a town across the border from the Mexican community of San Luis Rio Colorado. Watch Bush explain his plan -- 6:15 Asked about skepticism and criticism by some that Bush is using the border issue as a publicity stunt, the president told CNN, "To secure this border is going to require a comprehensive approach. Comprehensive means more agents, more technology and a temporary worker program." Bush is seeking $1.9 billion from Congress, for, among other things, the deployment of up to 6,000 National Guard troops to help Border Patrol agents. The number of troops will increase gradually to that number by 2008, Bush said, and will be reduced as the Border Patrol is able to increase its presence. "They will assist the Border Patrol by operating surveillance systems, building infrastructure, analyzing intelligence, and providing training until new Border Patrol officers and technologies come online," Bush wrote in a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert. Watch whether border technology actually works -- 2:04 "The request for additional resources, coupled with additional legal authority from the Congress, will end the practice of catch and release along our southern border once and for all by increasing detention, transportation, and removal capabilities," Bush said. The troops would have no law enforcement role, but their presence would free Border Patrol agents from logistical duties and speed construction projects along the border, Bush said. The National Guard troops will come from units in potentially every state, and will be under the command of the governors of the four southern border states of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Bush has promised the governors -- who can veto the use of their troops -- the federal government would repay them for their costs. During Bush's visits with border agents and other officials Thursday in Yuma, Arizona, he did not discuss either of two competing proposals in Congress -- one approved by the House that would build 700 miles of fence and one in the Senate that would build half that. Bush said this isn't the first time his administration has addressed the border issue. He said that since he took office in 2001, the number of border agents has increased from 9,000 to nearly 12,000. More than 100 agents have been added in the busy Yuma sector in the past year, for a total of 660, he said. New fencing, lighting and cameras have been added in key locations. "We're in the process of making the border the most technologically advanced in the world," Bush said. Opponents contend the barriers would shift illegal immigrant and smuggling traffic to areas of the border without fencing. More than 85 percent of the illegal immigrants come from Mexico, and most are sent home within 24 hours, he said. The president's guest-worker program would allow foreign workers to fill jobs in the United States for a limited time, after which they would return home. Immigrants with roots in the United States would be given a process to follow to gain citizenship, if they qualified. Bush stressed that opponents of his plan should not be considered racists. "I think it would be too harsh a judgment to say that somebody who doesn't support a comprehensive immigration plan is a racist," he said. Support growing Public support for President Bush's handling of immigration issues has improved, according to a CNN poll released Thursday. Thirty-six percent of respondents approved of his handling of immigration, up from 25 percent in a poll taken in January. By a 2-to-1 margin, those polled said they favored Bush's plan to deploy National Guard troops along the U.S.-Mexico border. And by an even larger margin -- 79 percent to 18 percent -- they said they favored allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for citizenship. However, respondents in the poll were more evenly split when it came to Bush's temporary worker program. Asked if they favored a program that would allow temporary workers to come to the United States without leading to citizenship, 48 percent were in favor and 46 percent opposed, which was within the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Sixty-two percent said immigration would be extremely or very important to their vote for Congress this year. But generally speaking, immigration remains low on the public's list of priorities. The economy, terrorism, the war in Iraq, public corruption and fuel prices rank higher. Fewer than half of those polled approved of Bush's handling of any of those subjects, and 57 percent said they disapproved of his performance in office. The president's overall approval rating stands at 36 percent, a slight improvement from the previous mark of 34 percent in a poll taken earlier this month. The poll, conducted for CNN by Opinion Research Corporation, surveyed 1,022 adults Tuesday and Wednesday. Story Tools</text>

<title>Opinion: What Obama could learn on the border - CNN.com</title>
<text>What Obama could learn on the border By Ruben Navarrette, CNN Contributor updated 2:28 PM EDT, Thu July 10, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette: President Obama should visit the border in light of crisis He says Obama's call for more spending is right, but won't stop flow of people seeking refuge Republicans will have to accept more spending on border and immigration, he says Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. Follow him on Twitter: @rubennavarrette . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. San Diego, California CNN -- It's the law of unintended consequences. Each time Americans spend billions to fortify the border by building fences or hiring Border Patrol agents, human traffickers raise their prices. Today, it costs about $3,000 to move a person across the border. It's less if you brave mountain lions and cross off the beaten path. It's more if you cross near civilization and absolutely positively have to be there overnight. If we bolster enforcement, the price could soar to $6,000. Ruben Navarrette Jr. How do we win a battle against an opponent when, the more we spend to defeat him, the more we empower him to fight back This riddle could stump anyone, but President Barack Obama seems to find it especially difficult. Raised in Hawaii and having lived in Chicago, Obama is a newbie to the border. He's made one memorable visit in 5½ as president and he must have felt as if he landed on another planet. Border Democrat on immigration crisis Even on this week's fundraising swing through Texas, Obama couldn't find time to visit the border. That was his loss. When you travel from San Diego to Douglas, Arizona, to Columbus, New Mexico, to Brownsville, Texas, it's like you're visiting several worlds at once. Each stretch has its own script. It's a fascinating area -- unless you're not interested. Obama doesn't seem all that interested in the border, except when he can use it as a weapon. In May 2011, during a visit to El Paso, Texas, Obama mocked Republicans by saying they wanted to build a moat on the border and fill it with alligators. View my Flipboard Magazine. This week, in Dallas, more than 500 miles from the border, the president revealed his plans for tens of thousands of kids whose heads are filled with nightmares. Since October, spurred by violent youth gangs in their home countries and fake news reports of "permisos" for young people approved by Congress, about 52,000 children and teenagers from Central America have been apprehended on the border. "Apprehended" is too generous a word, since most of these people reportedly went up to Border Patrol agents with their arms raised and asked to be arrested. These uninvited guests are neither invading nor evading. They're surrendering. A lot of Texas Democrats probably thought it was a bad idea for Obama to snub the border, and one said so out loud. U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, suggested that Obama's failure to survey firsthand the scene of the crisis evoked memories of President George W. Bush viewing the devastation of Hurricane Katrina from an airplane flying high overhead. This week, Cuellar said: "I hope this doesn't become the Katrina moment for President Obama, saying that he doesn't need to come to the border. He should come down." Now that U.S. officials have custody of the border kids, many of whom were -- according to media reports -- sexually assaulted or had their lives threatened, the hard part is deciding what to do with them. Do we really want to send them back Are we that monstrous Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion to deal with the crisis -- which includes $1.8 billion to help the Department of Health and Human Services provide better care for the children, and another $1.6 billion to help the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice expedite their removal. The remaining $300 million would go to the State Department to help Latin American governments counter the misinformation campaign. This budgetary whiplash -- where we show these kids some kindness before banishing them to the dark, desperate and dangerous places from which they escaped -- summarizes Obama's muddled approach to the immigration issue, where he tries to be both tough and compassionate and winds up confused. We need more border funding, but we could also use a lot more honestly and clarity in this debate. Money can't buy that. Liberals will have to swallow the fact that it was their foil, George W. Bush, who signed a law in 2008 giving safe haven to unaccompanied minors from Central America, and now it's their champion, Barack Obama, who seeks the power to override it. Meanwhile, conservatives are putting up a fight against the funding, but that won't last. They can't stand the idea of letting these kids stay here and grow up to become dependents and Democrats, and so they have to help Obama fund their return. For a while, there will be a tug-of-war in the GOP between the border hawks and budget hawks. But the former will win. That's a good outcome. It would also be good for Congress to pass immigration reform, and for Obama to ease up on deportations. For now, the administration needs the $3.7 billion, and it should get every penny. Congress should be generous, and the President should be diligent, but neither of them should be naive. On the border, enforcement dollars are no silver bullet. We can hire more Border Patrol agents, build more walls, and expedite deportations. But none of that will stop the downtrodden, desperate, and determined from seeking refuge in a country that is supposed to be in the business of offering it. And if Obama spent more time on the border, he'd already know that.</text>

<title>Civil unions become law in Delaware - CNN.com</title>
<text>Civil unions become law in Delaware By the CNN Wire Staff STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gov. Jack Markell signed the bill Wednesday night Delaware lawmakers passed the measure in April It will take effect January 1 CNN -- Calling it "a moment in our history," Delaware Gov. Jack Markell has signed a bill legalizing civil unions for same-sex couples in the state. The bill, which was passed by state lawmakers in April, will take effect January 1. "This bill is about a new energy and excitement," Markell said at the bill signing ceremony Wednesday night. "It's about a moment in our history that came about because people came together to work for it, because it became clear that Delaware's LGBT lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community is in fact part of every Delaware community. The greater good is served when we speak out and fight hard when we see that bias, prejudice or even outdated laws attempt to lessen any one of us." The measure does not allow same-sex couples to obtain marriage licenses, and religious institutions retain the right to refuse to solemnize such unions. Also under the bill, Delaware will recognize legal relationships that same-sex couples enter into in another jurisdiction, whether that is a civil union or a marriage, and treat the relationship as a civil union, according to Markell's office. Gay-rights groups lauded the new law. "Tonight is a wonderful night for LGBT equality in Delaware," said Lisa Goodman, president of Equality Delaware and the host of the bill-signing celebration, according to the statement issued by Markell's office. "The governor's signature on this legislation moves same-sex couples in Delaware closer to equality," said Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. "... It is not a substitute for full legal marriage, but it provides fundamental security for same-sex couples that will allow them to take care of each other and their families. This is reason to celebrate." Rep. Melanie George, the bill's sponsor in the Delaware House of Representatives, said she believes "with every fiber of my being that this is the right thing to do." "Tonight, we say to loving and committed couples across the state who want the law to endorse the promise they made long ago in their hearts: 'Your love is equally valid and deserving. Your family is now equal under the law,'" Markell said. The law makes Delaware the eighth state to offer civil unions or comprehensive domestic partnerships for same-sex couples, according to the Human Rights Campaign. The others are California, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington. Couples in Illinois can begin applying for civil union licenses on June 1, according to the organization, and Hawaii's law takes effect January 1. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.

<title>Priests in same-sex relationships may become Anglican Bishops - CNN.com</title>
<text>Priests in same-sex relationships may become Anglican Bishops By Ben Brumfield, CNN updated 11:50 AM EST, Sat January 5, 2013 The Church of England announced that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The priests in same-sex unions must remain celibate The Anglican Church recognizes marriage as being only between a man and a woman Sex should be practiced only within a marriage, the church says Women may be priests but are not allowed to become bishops CNN -- Men in a civil union will now be allowed to become bishops in the Church of England, but they are not allowed to have sex. Intercourse between two men -- or two women -- remains a sin. "Homosexual genital acts fall short of the Christian ideal and are to be met with a call to repentance and the exercise of compassion," according to Anglican doctrine. Men and women in same-sex unions were already allowed to serve as priests in the Church of England, but there was a moratorium on advancement to the episcopate -- becoming a bishop -- while the church considered the issue. The church announced Friday that if men in celibate civil unions may be priests, then there is no reason for them not to be bishops, as long as they are "living in accordance with the teaching of the Church on human sexuality." Any priest looking to become a bishop must undergo a thorough examination of "personal and family circumstances," according to a statement released by the House of Bishops of the Church of England. Female priests are barred from advancing to the position of bishop, as a vote on the measure in the church failed to pass lay approval last November despite an overwhelming majority of support within the church hierarchy. Women have been permitted to enter the priesthood since the early 1990s. The church defines marriage "as a faithful, committed, permanent and legally sanctioned relationship between a man and a woman, is central to the stability and health of human society." It believes sex should be practiced exclusively within a marriage. The British parliament is expected to consider legislation allowing same-sex marriage, but the Church of England and the Church in Wales would be prohibited from performing wedding ceremonies as long as it remains against canon law. In 2005, Britain allowed same-sex couples to register civil partnerships, prompting the church to consider the issue. It does not bless civil unions of any kind, for fear some of them may be sexual. But it also does not exclude gays and lesbians from the flock, according to it 2005 deliberations. The Anglican Church is a protestant denomination intimately associated with the American Episcopal Church. The church and state in Britain are formally connected. The two archbishops of the church, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, along with 24 other bishops, have seats in Parliament in the House of Lords. Though women may not yet rise to high positions in its clergy, Queen Elizabeth is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England.</text>

<title>Rhode Island legislature passes civil union bill - CNN.com</title>
<text>Rhode Island legislature passes civil union bill By David Ariosto, CNN NEW: Senate passes bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples NEW: If signed by Gov. Lincoln Chafee, the law would take effect on July 1 Civil unions are currently permitted in New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware and Hawaii CNN -- Less than a week after New York became the nation's sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, Rhode Island state lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favor of a bill that permits civil unions between gay and lesbian couples. The measure, which passed the state Senate by a count of 21-16, is widely seen as a compromise intended to provide same-sex couples with added rights and benefits, while also preventing an expanded legal definition of marriage. Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, is expected to sign the bill into law, according to his spokesman, Michael Trainor. If signed, the law would take effect on July 1, making Rhode Island the fifth state in the union to allow civil unions between same-sex couples. Such unions are currently permitted in New Jersey and Illinois, and will be allowed in Delaware and Hawaii beginning January 1, 2012. Three West Coast states -- California, Oregon and Washington -- plus Nevada, also allow for "comprehensive domestic partnerships," largely considered an equivalent to their civil union counterparts. Despite robust opposition to the measure, Rhode Island's Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bill by a vote of 7-4, sending it to the Democrat-controlled Senate floor where lawmakers voted in its favor, according to Senate spokesman, Greg Pare. Rhode Island passes civil union bill RELATED TOPICS Relationships The legislation, which passed overwhelmingly in the state's lower house on May 19, affords same-sex couples a host of new state tax breaks, health-care benefits and greater ease of inheritance. But it also drew sharp criticism from religious leaders and opposition groups who say it will lead to court-ordered action that would eventually legalize same-sex marriage. Similar legal action in Connecticut and Massachusetts resulted in those states adopting same-sex marriage laws, noted Christopher Plante, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage's Rhode Island chapter. Chafee -- who is supportive of potential legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage -- says civil unions are "a step in the right direction," according to Trainor. Meanwhile, gay rights activists -- like Marriage Equality Rhode Island -- say that while they support the civil union bill, they would prefer legislation that permits same-sex couples to wed. The group urged Chafee not to sign the measure if it includes a House amendment that permits groups with religious affiliations to refuse certain legal rights provided to civil unions. For instance, a hospital with a religious affiliation could refuse a civil union partner from being involved in the emergency medical care decisions of their spouse if it chose to do so, said Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the activist group. Chafee is "very aware of the concerns that have been expressed," Trainor said, but will likely sign the bill into law, which passed the Senate with the controversial amendment included. House spokesman Larry Berman called the issue a "red herring," pursued by the state's more radical activists. The exemption, he said, is meant to provide religious protections against potential litigation. "It's a small exception," Berman said, when compared to the slew of new rights and benefits same-sex couples would enjoy should the measure be signed into law. Currently, Rhode Island and Maine are the only states in New England that do not permit same-sex marriage. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo a signed a bill that legalizes same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in states that permit such unions. The measure will take effect on July 24, providing gay and lesbian couples with new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. Federal recognition, however, was not a part of Friday's vote, leaving benefits like Social Security and ease of immigration largely out of reach for same-sex couples. The controversial bill passed New York's Republican-controlled Senate before reaching Cuomo's desk, in an extended legislative session that left many skeptical over whether lawmakers would bring the measure to a vote. Iowa and the District of Columbia also allow gay and lesbian couples to wed. Share this on:</text>

<title>Witness: Civil unions like allowing just one bite of Twinkie - CNN.com</title>
<text>California San Francisco, California CNN -- A gay couple challenging Proposition 8 in federal court Monday said civil unions and domestic partnerships aren't the same as marriages, something they view as a stepping stone toward starting a family. "[It's] like putting a Twinkie at the end of a treadmill and saying, 'You can only have a bite,' " testified Paul Katami, one of the plaintiffs. "And you want the whole thing. ... All I want is to be married." Katami and his partner, Jeffrey Zarrillo, are among plaintiffs asking Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker of the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to issue an injunction against the enforcement of California's Proposition 8, arguing the ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. If allowed to marry his partner, 36-year-old Zarrillo said he would finally feel equal and complete. "I'd be able to stand there as one family, as a married individual," Zarrillo said, noting the "pride that one feels when that happens." During testimony, attorney David Boies asked Zarrillo why he believed marriage was a better option for same-sex couples when compared with domestic partnerships and other arrangements states have for same-sex couples. "Domestic partnership would relegate me to second-class citizenship, maybe third-class -- and that's not enough," he said. Zarrillo and Katami of Los Angeles, California, are joined by Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier of Berkeley, California, in the court challenge. Zarrillo said he believes it's an important step to be married before having children, saying it would make it easier for the couple and the child and would afford the child additional protections. Being married and wearing a wedding ring sends a message to society, he said. "It says to them, these individuals are serious," Zarrillo said. "They're committed to one another." Another attorney for the couples, Theodore Olson, argued to the judge that a ban on Proposition 8 leaves gay couples out of something available to all other people in the United States. "Marriage is central to life in America," Olson said. "It promotes mental, physical and emotional self. It's the building block of family, neighborhoods and community in our society." Proposition 8, Olson said, ended the dream of marriage for same-sex couples, which includes hundreds of thousands of Californians. The state, he said, "has put people into categories." "You're different, and we're going to take away that right from you," Olson said, interpreting the meaning of the ban. "... That's discrimination." However, Charles Cooper, an attorney representing Protect Marriage, the group that came up with Proposition 8, told the judge in his opening statement the purpose of marriage is to promote procreation between men and women. Same-sex marriage "will likely lead to very real social harm; it's too novel and experimental," he argued. Californians "are entitled to make this critical decision for themselves," he said, pointing to voter support of the proposition. Except for the issue of marriage, gays and lesbians have been successful in attaining policy goals, Cooper said, adding that California has some of the most comprehensive protections in the nation. About 100 protesters against the measure and in favor of same-sex marriage gathered peacefully outside the courthouse before the hearing, waving signs supporting equal rights. The case will likely head to the U.S. Supreme Court no matter the outcome. It is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether Americans can marry people of the same sex. In legal circles and across the Internet, it has been dubbed this generation's Brown v. Board of Education, the case that led to the Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in schools. Some say it could be the biggest ruling since Roe v. Wade, which tackled abortion. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. CNN's Mallory Simon and Bill Mears contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

<title>French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill - CNN.com</title>
<text>French lawmakers approve same-sex marriage bill By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN updated 11:38 AM EST, Tue February 12, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: France's lower house of parliament approves the bill 329 to 229 The legislation must be passed by the Senate before it can become law The Roman Catholic Church and other religious groups in France are opposed Supporters say same-sex couples should have equal rights to marry and adopt children CNN -- Same-sex marriage in France came one step closer to legality Tuesday, as lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples. The measure was voted through in the National Assembly by 329 in favor to 229 against, with 10 deputies abstaining. The bill must still go before the senate before it becomes law. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage. UK lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same-sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the House of Commons. Open Mic: French on same-sex marriage UK MPs approve legal same-sex marriage Gay bishop takes message on road But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation, which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron, the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron's Conservative Party. The bill must go through several more stages before it can become law. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the UK legislation. In the United States, where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage, it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia -- but many people remain vehemently opposed. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. Opinion: Why the fuss about gay marriage The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month. The left also controls the Senate. But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks. Another big rally against the law is planned for next month. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Same-sex marriage around the world Opening up marriage to same-sex couples "would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone," he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a "deceit" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and many lawmakers and hundreds of mayors are against the legislation. The legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates, however. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT has said the law, if passed, "would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights." Lawmakers have a "unique opportunity" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. "The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity," it said. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS pacte civil de solidarite, the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage. Opinion: Gay rights in France -- How even the U.S. leads the way Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriages. Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed, according to Pew. Nonetheless, 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The issue has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed "support marriage equality." According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws.

<title>Same-sex Marriage - Issues - Election Center 2008 - CNN.com</title>
<text>Primaries LGBT issues From the debate over same-sex marriage to the military's "Don't ask, don't tell policy," issues that affect the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trangender LGBT community look to play a prominent role in this year's presidential election. Read the stances of the presidential candidates below. The views of the vice presidential candidates are shown where available. REPUBLICANS John McCain Believes the institution of marriage is a union between one man and one woman. Voted for the Defense of Marriage Act but voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. Says states and local governments should set their own marriage policies. Voted against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1996. During an interview in 2000, McCain said: "I think that the present laws that clearly prevent a discrimination of any kind certainly [apply] to gays and homosexuals as well. That's why I voted the way that I did. I think that enforcement of existing law could work rather than passing special laws for special categories of people." When asked about the military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy, McCain said: "...I don't think there's any doubt that there are evolving attitudes in America about many issues, including this one, but every military leader that I talk to, I say 'Should we change it' They say, 'It's working.' And right now we've got the best military we've ever had -- the most professional, best trained, equipped and the bravest. And so I think it's logical to leave this issue alone. I really do." The McCain campaign states that gay adoption is a state issue and does not endorse any federal legislation. Sarah Palin Stated on Sarah Palin for Governor Web site: "I believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman." Stated during the vice presidential debate October 2, "No one would ever propose, not in a McCain-Palin administration, to do anything to prohibit, say, visitations in a hospital or contracts being signed, negotiated between parties." According to a New York Times report, she supported an amendment to the Alaska state constitution that would have banned same-sex marriage, but, during her tenure as governor, she vetoed a bill that would have denied health benefits to same-sex partners of public employees on grounds that it was unconstitutional. DEMOCRATS Barack Obama Opposes same-sex marriage, but also opposes a constitutional ban. Says he would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment. As stated on the Obama campaign Web site, he supports full civil unions that "give same-sex couples equal legal rights and privileges as married couples, including the right to assist their loved ones in times of emergency as well as equal health insurance, employment benefits, and property and adoption rights." Says the Employment Non-Discrimination Act should be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Advocated legislation that sought to expand federal hate crimes law to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Says the military's "Don't ask, don't tell" policy needs to be repealed. Joe Biden Opposes same-sex marriage. Voted against a constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. Supports civil unions. Says he believes legal recognition should not be denied to same-sex couples. Advocates re-examining federal laws, including the tax code, to ensure national laws are not unfair to same-sex couples and that committed adults who are adopting are not discriminated against because of sexual orientation. Supports letting states determine how to recognize civil unions and define marriage. Also supports ending the military's "don't ask, don't tell" Policy. Supports adding sexual orientation to the definition of hate crimes.</text>

<title>With veto overrides, Vermont legalizes same-sex marriage - CNN.com</title>
<text>Economy enters same-sex marriage debate The Human Rights Campaign, which describes itself as the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights organization, issued a statement applauding the votes, noting Vermont is the first state to legalize same-sex marriage through the legislative process. "This historic vote in the Vermont Legislature reminds us of the incredible progress being made toward equality," said Joe Solmonese, Human Rights Campaign president, in the statement. "Less than five years ago, lesbian and gay couples began marrying in Massachusetts. Now, with the Iowa court decision last Friday and today's vote in Vermont, there will be four states recognizing the right to marry for loving, committed lesbian and gay couples." Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin was quoted in the statement as saying, "The struggle for equal rights is never easy. I was proud to be president of the Senate nine years ago when Vermont created civil unions. Today we have overridden the governor's veto. I have never felt more proud of Vermont as we become the first state in the country to enact marriage equality, not as the result of a court order, but because it is the right thing to do." Vermont's neighboring state, New Hampshire , also has taken steps toward legalizing same-sex marriages. On March 26, the New Hampshire House passed a bill by seven votes that would legalize same-sex marriage, sending it to the Senate, according to the Concord Monitor newspaper. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch has said he opposes same-sex marriage but has not said whether he will veto a bill legalizing it. Like Vermont, New Hampshire allows civil unions for same-sex couples. "The civil unions bill [Lynch] signed into law prevents discrimination and provides the same legal protections to all New Hampshire families to the extent that is possible under federal law," Lynch spokesman Colin Manning told the Monitor. On Friday, the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a state law banning same-sex marriage. The decision upheld a 2007 ruling by a lower court that struck down Iowa's 1998 law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples. Polk County District Judge Robert Hanson found that the law violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection and hurt gay and lesbian couples "in numerous tangible and intangible" ways.</text>

<title>EPA limits carbon pollution from new power plants - CNN.com</title>
<text>EPA limits carbon pollution from new power plants By Aaron Cooper, CNN updated 12:01 PM EDT, Fri September 20, 2013 Steam rises form the cooling towers of the Burbank Water and Power natural-gas-fueled power plant in Burbank, California. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The standards are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants Existing power plants are exempt from these regulations, but others are coming Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia criticizes what he calls "impossible standards" Washington CNN -- The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing new rules aimed at limiting the amount of carbon pollution coming from new power plants. The standards, which would set separate limits for natural gas and coal power plants, are being called the first uniform national limits for new plants. "Power plants are the single largest sources of carbon pollution," EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said in remarks prepared for delivery at the National Press Club in Washington. "New power plants can minimize their carbon emissions by taking advantage of modern technologies. These technologies offer them a clear path forward, today and in the long-term." New coal power plants and small natural gas plants would be limited to 1,100 pounds of C02 emissions per megawatt-hour. Larger natural gas plants would be limited to one thousand pounds a megawatt-hour. These restrictions are slightly looser than a set first proposed in 2012. McCarthy said the new proposal factors in public feedback from public comments received last year. Existing power plants are exempt from the proposed carbon regulation, but McCarthy said regulations on those plants will be proposed in June. Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat who represents coal-rich West Virginia, criticized the administration as trying to hold the coal industry to "impossible standards" "Never before has the federal government forced an industry to do something that is technologically impossible. Forcing coal to meet the same emissions standards as gas when experts know that the required technology is not operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense and will have devastating impacts to the coal industry and our economy," he said in a written statement. McCarthy said the EPA has a history of pollution standards driving technological development. "The old rules may say we can't protect our environment and promote economic growth at the same time, but in America, we've always used new technologies, we've used science, we've used research and development and discovery to make the old rules obsolete," McCarthy said. The president and CEO of the National Mining Association also had harsh words for the proposal. "The regulation announced today by EPA effectively bans coal from America's power portfolio, leaving new power plants equipped with even the most efficient and environmentally advanced technologies out in the cold," said Hal Quinn, asserting that the EPA is "recklessly gambling with the nation's energy and economic future." He said standards should be based on the best technology available today. An EPA official briefing the media on the new clean air proposals Friday said that if they are finalized, the method of recouping costs associated with the new regulations would be determined by the industry. When pressed, the EPA official refused to say if the increased costs would be passed on to consumers. The standards will be open for public comment for 60 days, during which time the agency said, it plans to hold public hearings.</text>

<title>EPA administrator announces resignation - CNN.com</title>
<text>updated 1:13 PM EST, Thu December 27, 2012 EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson listens as President Obama delivers remarks to EPA employees in January. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The EPA head says she will step down after the State of the Union address Lisa Jackson has held the post for four years She says her goal was to focus on climate change while not ignoring other issues CNN -- Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson will step down after the president's January State of the Union speech, the agency said Thursday. Jackson thanked President Barack Obama for having placed her in the post four years ago and said she leaves the EPA "confident the ship is sailing in the right direction." It is not uncommon for agencies to change leadership when new presidential terms begin. Jackson said she is "ready in my own life for new challenges, time with my family and new opportunities to make a difference." In a statement, she recalled the goal she set at the beginning of her tenure to focus on climate change, but not to ignore other issues such as air pollution, toxic chemicals and waste-site cleanup issues. "The way to transform this country and make it ready for the next 100 years is through new legislation that addresses energy, that deals with climate change, that deals with the issues that people are so scared of," Jackson told CNN at the beginning of her tenure as administrator. The Obama administration's record on the passing tough environmental laws has been mixed. Under Jackson's leadership, the EPA created new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants. It was the first time that U.S. coal- and oil-fired power plant operators were required to limit their emissions of mercury and other hazardous pollutants. Jackson also vigorously defended her agency against a 2010 bill that would have stopped the EPA from regulating carbon emissions. She wrote a column where she accused the bill's backers of siding with "big oil companies and their lobbyists" in an effort to "take away EPA's ability to protect the health and welfare of Americans from greenhouse gas pollution." The bill was defeated in the Senate. "Over the last four years, Lisa Jackson has shown an unwavering commitment to the health of our families and our children," Obama said in a statement. "Under her leadership, the EPA has taken sensible and important steps to protect the air we breathe and the water we drink, including implementing the first national standard for harmful mercury pollution, taking important action to combat climate change under the Clean Air Act, and playing a key role in establishing historic fuel economy standards that will save the average American family thousands of dollars at the pump, while also slashing carbon pollution." During this year's presidential campaign, GOP candidate Mitt Romney accused Jackson and two other Obama appointees of pursuing policies that drive up gasoline prices. He called for her firing. There were times when Obama himself became an obstacle to Jackson. In September 2011, Obama ordered Jackson to scrap a plan for reducing ozone pollution. At the time, the president stressed his environmental record, but said the additional regulations would create uncertainty that could slow down the economic recovery. The move was criticized by environmentalists who accused Obama of siding with corporate polluters over the public's health. The EPA had argued that increasing the standard would save 4,300 lives per year, prevent 7,000 hospital visits and avoid 2.6 million missed days of work or school. Amid rumors that Jackson would leave the agency, a grassroots movement emerged online, asking her to remain on the job, which she did. Jackson said that her background as a mother, a graduate from Princeton and Tulane universities and resident of New Orlean's 9th Ward allows her to tackle the issues facing the environment. She was the first African-American to head up the EPA, a distinction she gave weight to as she undertook her work. "I don't think of it every moment," she told CNN as she entered the job. "But what I hope that we see at the end of this are activists who look like me -- activists who represent the future demographic of our country, because that's who's going to be the EPA in the future."</text>

<title>Western Australia kills its first shark as part of cull - CNN.com</title>
<text>Shark culling begins in Western Australia, angering conservationists By Peter Shadbolt, CNN updated 10:38 AM EST, Mon January 27, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Western Australian government kills first shark as part of a controversial culling program Shooting of a three-meter tiger shark draws an angry response from activists Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in WA over the past three years The state's premier Colin Barnett defended the bait-and-kill policy, saying it put people first CNN -- The Western Australian government killed its first shark over the weekend as part of a controversial culling program that has drawn an angry reaction from conservationists and activists. A spokesman for the Western Australia WA government confirmed that a commercial fisherman had caught and shot a three-meter tiger shark one kilometer off Old Dunsborough in the South West region. The government's program of using hooked lines attached to floating drums to cull sharks in its waters follows a spate of fatal shark attacks in the waters off Australia's largest state. Seven people have been killed in shark attacks in WA over the past three years, the government said. The scheme has been denounced by conservationists who say the sea predators should remain protected species. The culling program went ahead after federal environment minister Greg Hunt granted WA an exemption under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act allowing the state to hunt down sharks. The exemption allows it to hunt the protect great white shark, one of the world's largest marine predators. Aussie freaks out by 10-foot visitor Shark, dolphin or is this even real "To think this shark had been in the water for 12 hours, possibly with a big bleeding hook in its mouth suffering, is just ridiculous," Sea Shepherd spokeswoman Rae Threnoworth told CNN affiliate Sky News. The state's premier Colin Barnett, however, said the bait-and-kill policy puts people first. "I get no pleasure from seeing sharks killed, but I have an overriding responsibility to protect the people of Western Australia, and that's what I'm doing," Mr Barnett told a press conference. Opponents have pledged to interfere with the program and Australian media reported that shark cull activists had removed bait from drum lines. The WA Department of Fisheries is currently working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program as part of its research and protection program. Shark Monitoring Network Project Manager Mark Kleeman said the new monitor near the Busselton Jetty, 220km south of the state capital Perth, would allow beach safety authorities to know, through near real-time alerts, if a tagged shark was in the vicinity. "Expansion of the satellite-linked network is part of a long-term project to improve safety at West Australian beaches, which will also help scientists better understand the movements of tagged sharks through WA waters," Mr Kleeman said in a government release. Besides the satellite-linked monitors, there are also approximately 320 seabed monitors located around the South and West coasts that record movements of tagged sharks. Mr Kleeman said each time data was physically retrieved from those monitors it would also help to establish a much broader understanding of shark behaviur and movement in WA waters. "338 sharks have now been tagged for the ongoing Shark Monitoring Network project and the ongoing tagging program will continue to help provide even more data," he said.</text>

<title>Toxic towns: People of Mossville 'are like an experiment' - CNN.com</title>
<text>Toxic towns: People of Mossville 'are like an experiment' By David S. Martin, CNN Medical Senior Producer Town says chemicals sicken For decades, Mossville residents have complained about health problems Community suspects 14 chemical plants play a role in cancer and diseases in area Group asked for relocation of residents, free health clinic and lower emissions How safe is the air you're breathing, and where is it coming from Tune in to "Toxic America," a two-night special investigation , with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, June 2 and 3 at 8 p.m. ET. Westlake, Louisiana CNN -- Gather current and former Mossville, Louisiana, residents in a room and you're likely to hear a litany of health problems and a list of friends and relatives who died young. "I got cancer. My dad had cancer. In fact, he died of cancer. It's a lot of people in this area who died of cancer," says Herman Singleton Jr., 51, who also lost two uncles and an aunt to cancer. Singleton and many others in this predominantly African-American community in southwest Louisiana suspect the 14 chemical plants nearby have played a role in the cancer and other diseases they say have ravaged the area. For decades, Mossville residents have complained about their health problems to industry, and to state and federal agencies. Now with a new Environmental Protection Agency administrator outspoken about her commitment to environmental justice, expectations are growing. Herman Singleton Jr. has cancer, so does his father, and he lost two uncles and an aunt to cancer. Debra Ramirez said her sister died of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. Dorothy Felix belongs to a local environmental group asking the government to intervene for health reasons. "I'm pretty hopeful now," say Debra Ramirez, 55, who grew up in Mossville and who lost a sister at 45 of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. "I do see her trying to do the right thing." Lisa Jackson, a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, and the first African-American administrator of the EPA, this year listed environmental justice as one of her seven priorities. And the EPA held a meeting in Mossville last month formally kicking off a study designed to see if the community qualifies as a Superfund site, reserved for the most polluted places in the United States. Superfund site designation would bring federal funding for cleaning up Mossville. Mossville Environmental Action Now MEAN, the local environmental group, has asked government and industry to relocate residents who want to leave, offer a free health clinic and lower emissions from the plants. Superfund relocates residents only as a last resort. "There are people that are getting sick; there are people who are dying because of what is happening in our community. These chemicals are killing us. They will destroy Mossville if nothing happens," says Dorothy Felix of MEAN.

<title>CNN - The debate over environment protection  - April 22, 1996</title>
<text>Web posted at: 3:15 p.m. EDT From Correspondent Jeanne Meserve WASHINGTON CNN -- Congressman Richard Gephardt stands behind the podium, his voice firm and his message clear. "Speaker Gingrich, as we all know, is quite a fan of visiting zoos -- maybe because he knows that by the time the Republicans are through, a lot of these animals might be extinct," the Missouri representative says. Since Republicans gained the majority in Congress, a heated political debate over the environment has erupted. Republicans have threatened to decrease environmental protection standards, while Democrats have fought to uphold them. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, has even called the Environmental Protection Agency "the Gestapo of government." Carol Browner, an EPA administrator, has countered by saying the GOP has "launched an orchestrated, assertive assault" against the agency, ultimately threatening public health and environmental laws. 224K AIFF sound or 224K WAV sound And while the debate has stirred in Washington, a Republican pollster found that "by greater than a 2-to-1 margin, voters have more confidence in the Democrats than Republicans to protect the environment." Clinton's cause Democrats have pounced on the issue. President Clinton on Monday announced that his administration will take up 20 environmental initiatives through legislative and presidential directives. Vice President Al Gore has spoken up for environmental protection, Secretary of State Warren Christopher has declared the environment a priority in international affairs, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has criticized Republicans for their handling of environmental issues. 96K AIFF sound or 96K WAV sound GOP does its share Republicans don't buy it. The GOP says the Clinton administration has a lackluster environmental record. "They haven't done a heck of a lot," says Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-New York. "They've talked a good game. They haven't played a great game." Plus, Republicans point to their past environmental record. President Richard Nixon established the EPA, and President George Bush acted to curb acid rain and the use of chlorofluorocarbons. More recently, the GOP has supported more funding for the Florida Everglades. And House Speaker Newt Gingrich hosted CNN's Larry King Live in which he discussed the importance of exotic animals. Critics like Browner say only the words have changed. 128K AIFF sound or 128K WAV sound "As the governor of Florida asked, 'How can you be for the Everglades and against wetlands'" Browner said. Despite the partisan split, some Congressional leaders have urged bipartisan cooperation. But since this is an election year, bipartisan efforts might just go up in smoke. Feedback</text>

<text>Primaries Environment Most scientists believe that a rise in the Earth's temperatures is worsened by the effect of greenhouse gases. The debate centers on how much government should regulate industry and whether that will affect climate change or be an expensive boondoggle. Read the stances of the presidential candidates below. The views of the vice presidential candidates are shown where available. REPUBLICANS John McCain Introduced the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007 with Sen. Joseph Lieberman I-CT. The legislation is designed to significantly reduce the nation's greenhouse gases, accomplished through a combination of trading markets and the deployment of advanced technologies. Would propose use of alternative energy sources, including nuclear. Sarah Palin Asked by ABC News in September, 2008, whether she believes global warming is the result of a natural cycle or human activity, Palin said, "I'm attributing some of man's activities to potentially causing some of the changes in the climate right now." However, around the same time, she was quoted by conservative Newsmax magazine, as saying, "A changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state, because of our location. ... I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made." DEMOCRATS Barack Obama Would implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level recommended by top scientists. Would make the United States a leader in the global effort to combat climate change by leading anew international global warming partnership. Would establish a National Low Carbon Fuel Standard LCFS to speed the introduction of low-carbon non-petroleum fuels. Would create a Technology Transfer program within the Department of Energy dedicated to exporting climate-friendly technologies to developing countries. Would offer incentives to maintain forests globally and manage them sustainably. Would develop domestic incentives that reward forest owners, farmers and ranchers when they plant trees, restore grasslands or undertake farming practices that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Joe Biden Co-sponsored a 2006 Senate bill that said global warming "was a threat to international stability as well as a risk to the environment and our economy." In a statement released by Biden's Senate office in May, 2006, he said, "The scientific evidence is clear: We need to take significant steps toward worldwide reduction of greenhouse gases to avoid permanently altering our climate." Obama and McCain: Key Senate Votes from 2005 through 2008 Greenhouse Gases June 6, 2008 -- The U.S. Senate refuses to limit debate -- by a vote of 48-36 -- on an amendment for a bill that called for the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a program to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases. McCain: Did not vote Obama: Did not vote Drilling in Alaska's Artic National Wildlife Refuge ANWR December 21, 2005 -- The U.S. Senate rejects, by a vote of 56-44, a motion to limit debate on fiscal 2006 Defense spending bill that would open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration. McCain: Yea Obama: Nay Global Warming June 22, 2005 -- The U.S. Senate rejects -- by a vote of 44-53 -- a motion to table a resolution sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman D-N.M. that expressed the opinion of the Senate on climate change legislation. The legislation addresses the need to control the emission of greenhouse gases. The resolution was then adopted by a voice vote. McCain: Nay</text>

<title>Thinner is better to curb global warming, study says - CNN.com</title>
<text>Thinner is better to curb global warming, study says Story Highlights Transporting heavier people requires more fuel, generating more greenhouse gas Study compared BMI distribution in UK in 1970s with predictions for 2010 Governments should encourage active transportation, study author says By Elizabeth Landau CNN CNN -- Here's yet another reason to stay in shape: Thinner people contribute less to global warming, according to a new study. More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and about 300 million are obese. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study showing that, because of food production and transportation factors, a population of heavier people contributes more harmful gases to the planet than a population of thin people. Given that it takes more energy to move heavier people, transportation of heavier people requires more fuel, which creates more greenhouse gas emissions, the authors write. "The main message is staying thin. It's good for you, and it's good for the planet," said Phil Edwards, senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The study offers this novel approach to the global warming problem as U.S. lawmakers discuss the future of climate change legislation. This week, the the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to begin on a comprehensive energy and climate bill. On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that six greenhouse gases pose potential health hazards, an announcement that could prompt the regulation of the gases. More than 1 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and about 300 million are obese , the study said. Generally, the body mass index, a measure of obesity, is increasing in most countries worldwide, from China to European countries to the United States. BMI is going up because of the availability of food and motorized transportation, Edwards said. People are less active now than they were 30 years ago, and the prevalence of fast food has given people less healthy, more energy-dense options. Health Library Using statistical models, the authors compared the distribution of BMI in the United Kingdom in the 1970s -- when 3.5 percent of the population was obese -- with a prediction for the country's BMI distribution in 2010, reflecting 40 percent obesity. "In terms of environmental impact, the lean population has a much smaller carbon footprint," Edwards said. The population with 40 percent obese people requires 19 percent more food energy for its total energy expenditure than the population with 3.5 percent obese people, the study showed. This 19 percent increase in food consumption translates into an increase of 270 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, the study said. "The findings make sense and highlight an important global co-benefit of losing weight, along with the significant personal health benefits," said Patrick Kinney, associate professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. In terms of obesity rate, the U.S. population is not far off from the overweight population model in this study. The country has 33.3 percent obese people, according to the Mayo Clinic. The study suggests that governments have a responsibility to encourage people to be more physically active, Edwards said. Active transportation, such as cycling and walking, helps maintain a healthy weight but requires safe streets, he said. "If the government wants to promote active transport, which would be good for the environment and for individual health, it needs to make the environment safe to do that," he said. Although climate change has come into the forefront as a major world problem recently, this is not the first time scholars have thought about the connection between fossil fuel and body fat. In 1978, a year the United States experienced an oil shock, a study in the American Journal of Public Health showed that if all overweight people in the country aged 18 to 79 reached their optimal weight, the resulting energy savings would equal 1.3 billion gallons of gasoline. After the dieting period, about 750 million gallons of gasoline would be saved every year, said the authors, Bruce Hannon, professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and Timothy Lohman, now professor emeritus at the University of Arizona. Today, research has shown that the obesity epidemic costs the United States about $100 billion a year, said Dr. Martin Donohoe of Portland State University, who runs the Web site Public Health and Social Justice. In terms of energy expenditure, the average food product travels 1,500 miles to get to your table, he said. Some measures to curb obesity include making healthier meals available in schools, putting nutritional information on food packages and menus, and banning trans fats, he said.</text>

<title>EU launches military operation in Central African Republic - CNN.com</title>
<text>EU launches military operation in Central African Republic By Tom Watkins, CNN updated 1:24 PM EDT, Tue April 1, 2014 A muslim woman sits in the courtyard of the Catholic church of Bossamptele where she has taken refuge on March 7, 2014. STORY HIGHLIGHTS EU forces will operate in the capital city of Bangui and in the airport "It is vital that there is a return to public order as soon as possible," EU says Central African Republic was plunged into chaos last year after ouster of the President CNN -- Help is on the way. The European Union announced in a news release that it is launching a military operation to restore stability to the Central African Republic. The operation's mission "is to provide temporary support in achieving a safe and secure environment in the Bangui area, with a view to handing over to a U.N. peacekeeping operation or to African partners," it said. "The force will thereby contribute both to international efforts to protect the populations most at risk and to the creation of the conditions for providing humanitarian aid." HRW: People cheered lynching of Muslims Archbishop and imam unite U.N.: Half of all C.A.R. citizens need aid Central African Republic president quits The forces -- known by the acronym EUFOR RCA -- will operate in the capital city of Bangui and in its airport. "The launch of this operation demonstrates the EU's determination to take full part in international efforts to restore stability and security in Bangui and right across the Central African Republic," said Catherine Ashton, the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy and vice president of the commission, in a statement. "It is vital that there is a return to public order as soon as possible, so that the political transition process can be put back on track." Though the announcement did not say how many troops were to be sent, a news briefing was scheduled for Wednesday in Brussels, Belgium, with Maj. Gen. Philippe Ponties, commander of the operation. Also on Wednesday, a high-level meeting to be held in the margins of the EU-Africa summit was to include several African and European heads of state as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. France, the former colonial power in the Central African Republic, deployed 1,600 personnel there to support African Union troops in December after a U.N. Security Council vote authorizing military intervention. The African nation was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels known as Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. Attempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn country have prompted "a Muslim exodus of historic proportions," Amnesty International has warned. In a statement last month , it said that areas of the capital were increasingly controlled by Christian militias, which have filled the power vacuum created by Bozize's ouster and attacked civilians and African Union-led peacekeepers. "This flare-up in violence is cause for serious concern, given the backdrop of ethnic cleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity across the Central African Republic since last December," said Christian Mukosa, the organization's Central Africa researcher. "It is just further evidence of what Amnesty International has been saying for months -- that the small contingent of peacekeeping troops on the ground will not be able to protect civilians effectively without more help from the international community." Since March 22, the Red Cross has recorded at least 15 civilian deaths in Bangui, and Doctors Without Borders, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has treated dozens of people for life-threatening wounds sustained in attacks. The attacks have taken place despite the installation in January of a transitional government and the presence of 6,000 African Union-led troops and 2,000 French soldiers. "Extrajudicial executions, torture, looting and other atrocities are perpetrated against civilians on a daily basis," Amnesty said. "The organization was the first to document ethnic cleansing of the country's Muslim population in January: thousands have since fled to neighbouring countries where they are now facing another humanitarian catastrophe due to dire living conditions."

<title>Croatia becomes newest EU member - CNN.com</title>
<text>Make that 28: Croatia becomes newest EU member From Oliver Joy and Deanna Hackney, CNN updated 1:19 PM EDT, Mon July 1, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS "Welcome to our union," EU president says Croatia is facing several challenges "The EU will not be a panacea for Croatia's economy," an analyst says CNN -- Croatia formally became the newest member of the European Union on Monday, marking an end to a 10-year campaign for a Balkan state that emerged from the ruins of a bloody civil war. The celebrations began as the clock struck midnight Sunday. Fireworks lit the sky in the capital Zagreb, a choir sang "Ode to Joy" and thousands clinked champagne glasses and erupted in cheers. "Welcome to your union, welcome to our union," EU President Herman Van Rompuy told the crowd. The nation of 4.4 million people is the 28th member of the EU, and the second Balkan country that rose out of the ashes of Yugoslavia to join the union. Slovenia became a member in 2004. Croatia set to join European Union Croatia welcomes EU membership Croatia's road to EU membership "Whatever anyone is saying about us, you should know we are a country of rational people who are realistic about themselves and their country, and the role of their country in Europe and the world," Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic told the crowd. Croatia looks to oil and gas fields in Adriatic Sea Many challenges With a low credit rating of junk and a political class stained by accusations of endemic corruption, Croatia's challenges are unlikely to disappear overnight. It is three years into a debt crisis that is plaguing countries across southern Europe. One of the challenges facing Croatia is its growth prospects. The financial crash of 2008 brought about a harsh double-dip recession that left the country's economy lingering in the doldrums. Last year, unemployment peaked at 17.3% which is behind only Greece and Spain, according to Eurostat - the European Commission's data archive. "The EU will not be a panacea for Croatia's economy," Will Bartlett, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics, told CNN in January. Fighting corruption Croatia is also in the midst of cleaning up a political class that is rife with corruption. Since the country's inception in the early 1990s, it has struggled to choke off profiteering from those in positions of power. Transparency International - an organization tackling corruption -- ranked Croatia below Rwanda, Jordan and Cuba in its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2012. But the country still came in above Italy - Europe's third largest economy. "The country's evolution has been very slow since 1990," said Zorislav Petrovic, head of Transparency Internernational in Croatia. But the current government - led by Milanovic - is taking steps to clean up the country's act under close supervision from the European Union. In November, the country's former Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of taking pay-offs from foreign companies. Sanader - who was premier from 2004 to 2009 - had fled the country but was arrested in Austria. Kristof Bender, deputy chairman of the policy institute, European Stability Initiative, says Croatia's progress to the "doorstep of the European Union" is quite remarkable. "We mustn't forget how bad it was in the 1990s," Bender said. "The darkest moments of war, occupation, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, and autocratic leadership and crony capitalism were all there."</text>

<title>How do illegal immigrants get into the European Union? - CNN.com</title>
<text>How do illegal immigrants get into the European Union By CNN Staff updated 6:58 AM EDT, Wed October 30, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Frontex: At least 72,000 illegally entered EU via land and sea routes in 2012 51% of migrants entering illegally took an eastern Mediterranean route, says border agency Migrant crossings through central Mediterranean, including Lampedusa, are on the rise Frontex says majority of those living illegally in Europe arrived by plane with valid travel visa CNN -- The death of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa in early October has shone a spotlight on illegal immigration to Europe. But although the tragedy at Lampedusa shocked the world, it has done little to dissuade migrants who continue to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from northern Africa to European shores. MORE: On patrol with Frontex in the 'sea of death' Frontex, the European Union border agency, says the majority of people residing illegally in the EU arrived by plane with a valid travel visa and simply stayed on after their visa expired. But Frontex also estimates that at least 72,000 people illegally entered the EU via land and sea routes in 2012 -- and the actual figure may be much higher. Patrolling the 'Sea of Death' Cercone: Frontex needs more resources Lampedusa: Refugees' gateway to Europe According to Frontex's "Annual Risk Analysis 2013" report, 51% of migrants entering illegally via land and sea took an eastern Mediterranean route, with many crossing into Greece before continuing on to the western Balkans by land or through ferry links to Italy. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning While detections of illegal border crossings dropped in the western Mediterranean area between northern Africa and Spain, attempted migrant incursions through the central Mediterranean region -- including Italy -- are up in 2012, according to the report. Many of the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in places like Syria and Libya. The deaths of hundreds of migrants in early October has prompted EU leaders to review the bloc's immigration policies. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize The EU's commissioner for home affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, issued a statement in early October calling on European nations to give Frontex the resources to mount "a wide Frontex search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean, from Cyprus to Spain." The EU also said it is setting up a new border surveillance system and Mediterranean task force to bolster its efforts and will review its asylum immigration policies next summer. But in the meantime, observers don't expect any let-up in migrant boats attempting to reach the shores of southern Europe. Explore the breakdown of the routes immigrants are taking into the EU in the infographic above.</text>

<title>Russia's Putin issues retaliatory ban on food imports - CNN.com</title>
<text>Russia's Putin issues retaliatory ban on food imports By Susanna Capelouto, Catherine E. Shoichet and Phil Black, CNN updated 7:04 PM EDT, Wed August 6, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Sanctions are "putting enormous pressure" on Russia's economy, Obama says President Putin bans imports from countries that imposed sanctions on Russia Details of banned products still to be worked out Russia gets 16% of all its imports from the European Union Moscow CNN -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has named a new target as global sparring over Ukraine grows: food. In a decree signed Wednesday, Putin banned food and agricultural imports from countries that have imposed sanctions against his country. The retaliatory move comes more than a week after the United States and European Union increased economic sanctions on Moscow for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia. A list of specific products and food bans is still being worked out by the Russian government, according to the decree, which describes the order as a special economic measure "aimed at ensuring the security of the Russian Federation." Reporting in Ukraine as fighters close in Ukraine's broken military Does Putin want war in Ukraine Russia is Europe's largest importer in value of animals, meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, according to the European Union. And goods from the EU represent 16% of all Russian imports, EU numbers show. Search for MH17 victims halted for now Putin said measures would be taken to prevent a jump in food prices in Russia. A senior U.S. administration official told CNN a ban in imports will only deepen Russia's international isolation and work against the country's own economic interest. "Russia's Central Bank yesterday pointed out that bans on imported food will push up Russia's already high inflation rate, eroding the purchasing power of Russian citizens," the official said. The United States insists that sanctions against Russian businesses and individuals are having and effect and already weakened Russia's economy. "Sanctions are working as intended in putting enormous pressure and strain on the Russian economy. ... The economy has ground to halt," U.S. President Barack Obama told reporters on Wednesday. If Putin doesn't push to resolve problems in eastern Ukraine through diplomacy and peaceful means, Obama said, "he's going to be hurting his economy and his own people over the long term." But so far, Obama said, violence in Ukraine hasn't stopped even as sanctions against Russia have increased. "The issue is not resolved yet," he said. 'You still have fighting in eastern Ukraine. Civilians are dying." Russia has denied allegations that it's supporting separatists in Ukraine and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis. But U.S. and Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to pro-Russian separatists. Several countries imposed sanctions on Moscow after Russia annexed Crimea in March, which escalated the Ukraine conflict following the ouster of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych a month earlier. Since then, tensions have simmered and flared in Ukraine, with frequent battles between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russia separatists in the eastern part of the country. A new buildup of Russian troops along the Ukraine border raised concerns Tuesday that Moscow might be contemplating another intervention like the annexation of Crimea. According to a NATO official, Russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed "in an area along the entire border with eastern Ukraine." The buildup nearly doubled the troop deployment in the last week by adding 8,000 more forces to 12,000 already there, the official said. In addition, Russia's Defense Ministry is staging a week of military exercises involving air troops and anti-missile defense forces. The exercises are taking place in Russia's southern Astrakhan region, roughly 500 miles from the border with Ukraine. Similar military exercises in the region preceded the annexation of Crimea.</text>

<title>Hezbollah slams EU's blacklisting of its military arm - CNN.com</title>
<text>Hezbollah slams EU's blacklisting of its military arm By Saad Abedine. Nick Paton Walsh and Joe Sterling, CNN updated 6:08 AM EDT, Tue July 23, 2013 Women hold Hezbollah flags and a picture of the movement's chief, Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon on May 25. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hezbollah: The EU's decision was "written by American hands using Israeli ink" The Lebanese Shiite group has been supporting the Syrian regime A Syrian opposition group says praises the EU's decision but says it can go further Kerry: The move will allow European agencies to crack down on Hezbollah's fundraising CNN -- Hezbollah denounced the European Union's decision to list its military wing as a terrorist organization, calling the move "aggressive and imbalanced." The Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group is already viewed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. In recent months, it has joined forces with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in that country's ongoing civil war. Hezbollah issued a statement Tuesday saying the EU's decision Monday was "written by American hands using Israeli ink" and that "all that was left for the Europeans to do was to sign the document and approve the legislation." Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said he hoped that the European Union had read data and facts about Hezbollah more thoroughly before making the decision, the state-run National News Agency reported. The report did not specify what data about Hezbollah the prime minister was referring to. Hezbollah leader acknowledges fighters' presence in Syria town The EU move The European Union agreed to target just the military component, a European diplomat told CNN. Critics of such an approach say designating part of an entity isn't effective or practical. But Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni's spokeswoman called the decision "correct and just," adding that it "puts an end to the wrong argument" that Hezbollah's military activities are absolved by the group's political status. "Even if Hezbollah is a political party, that does not whitewash and make legitimate their terrorist activities," the spokeswoman said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the move "will have a significant impact on Hezbollah's ability to operate freely in Europe by enabling European law enforcement agencies to crack down on Hezbollah's fundraising, logistical activity and terrorist plotting." "As Hezbollah has deepened its support for the brutal Assad regime and worked to expand its global reach through increased involvement in international criminal schemes and terrorist plots around the world, a growing number of governments are recognizing Hezbollah as the dangerous and destabilizing terrorist organization that it is," Kerry said. The Syrian National Coalition, an affiliation of Syrian dissident groups, praised the EU's move -- but said the group could do more. "We urge the European Union to extend their decision to include all of Hezbollah political officials who are part of the decision making" of the party's military wing, the SNC said in a statement Tuesday. The SNC also called for "the trial of all of Hezbollah's officials for their crimes of terrorism committed against our Syrian people and on our soil." Donilon: Hezbollah not a 'responsible political actor' Hezbollah was formed after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 to go after the Palestine Liberation Organization. The group has been accused of high-profile terror attacks over the years. Opinion: Time for G8 to make Hezbollah statement "Hezbollah first gained notoriety in 1983 after it bombed the United States Embassy in Beirut -- an attack that killed 63 people," wrote Tom Donilon, President Barack Obama's former national security adviser, in a New York Times column this year. "Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah bombed the American and French Marine Barracks in Beirut, killing 241 Americans and 58 French service members with one of the largest explosive devices ever detonated during a terrorist attack." The group also conducted a series of kidnappings, airplane hijackings and bombings in the 1980s and 1990s, Donilon wrote. He said the group has tried to portray itself as a political entity focused on social services and defending the country. "But it is an illusion to speak of Hezbollah as a responsible political actor," Donilon said. "Hezbollah remains a terrorist organization and a destabilizing force across the Middle East."

<title>Swiss voters narrowly approve immigration limits - CNN.com</title>
<text>Swiss voters narrowly approve immigration limits By Elwyn Lopez, CNN updated 7:32 PM EST, Sun February 9, 2014 A man walks past posters from the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party ahead of Sunday's referendum STORY HIGHLIGHTS Vote reflects "unease with regard to population growth," Swiss government says Swiss Federal Council warned limits would make it harder for businesses to find workers Foreigners make up a fourth of Switzerland's workforce and 20% of its population EU: It's against "free circulation of people between the European Union and Switzerland" CNN -- Swiss voters narrowly approved a referendum to place new limits on foreigners living and working in Switzerland. The country's Federal Council, which officially opposed the constitutional change, called the vote "a reflection of unease with regard to population growth in recent years." The council had warned that passage would make it harder for Swiss businesses to find workers and would harm relations with the European Union. Foreign workers from the EU have been allowed to freely commute from France and other countries into Switzerland to work, while there have been few restrictions on foreign nationals moving into the country to live. Switzerland, which is not a part of the European Union, will not have to renegotiate agreements with the EU, the Federal Council said. The European Commission issued a statement Sunday expressing "regrets" about the passage of the immigration quotas. "That goes against the principle of free circulation of people between the European Union and Switzerland," it said. "The European Union will examine the implications of this initiative with all relations between the European Union and Switzerland." Foreigners make up about a fourth of Switzerland's workforce and 20% of its population. The immigrant community is dominated by Albanians, Bosnians and Turks, though most were denied a vote in Sunday's referendum because of the difficulty of gaining Swiss citizenship. "The new constitutional provisions require that residence permits for foreign nationals be restricted using quantitative limits and quotas," the Swiss government statement said. "These limits and quotas will apply to all permits covered by legislation on foreign nationals, including cross-border commuters and asylum seekers, and must be geared towards Switzerland's overall economic interests. Businesses must give Swiss nationals priority when hiring staff." Before the vote, the Federal Council issued a statement saying the foreign workers "make a significant contribution to Switzerland's prosperity. The Swiss economy has relied on foreign workers for decades. Manufacturing, construction, health care, academia and research, gastronomy and agriculture are dependent on workers from abroad."

<title>Belgium: Lawmakers vote on children's right to choose euthanasia - CNN.com</title>
<text>Belgium: Lawmakers vote for children's 'right to die' euthanasia law By Laura Smith-Spark and Diana Magnay, CNN updated 1:22 PM EST, Thu February 13, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Lower house of Parliament votes 86 to 44 in favor NEW: Open letter signed by 175 pediatricians called for more time to consider the issue The law would allow terminally ill minors who are in intolerable pain to choose euthanasia Stringent conditions would have to be met, including consent by the child's parents CNN -- Does a terminally ill child in intolerable pain have a right to die Belgian lawmakers said yes. The lower house of the Belgian Parliament adopted a bill that extends the right to euthanasia for minors, the Parliament said Thursday on its official Twitter account. The law passed 86 to 44 with 12 abstentions. That followed a vote by the country's Senate in December supporting the measure. The next step would see the bill go to the king, Philippe, to be signed into law. The euthanasia bill is widely supported -- but has stoked fierce opposition from critics. Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in "constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated." Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. The new bill would extend the "right to die" to those under the age of 18 only under certain strict conditions, including that the child is judged able to understand what euthanasia means. Consent of parents or guardians must also be given. Belgium's controversial euthanasia law Professor: Doctors should not be killing Belgian lawmaker backs child euthanasia law Mother Linda van Roy, from Schilde, Belgium, is among those backing the bill. She could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby, Ella-Louise, in the last hours of her life. Ella-Louise, who was 10 months old when she died just over two years ago, would never have qualified for euthanasia. But her mother had to watch as her baby -- who had Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system -- slowly faded away under palliative sedation, food and liquid withheld so her suffering was not further prolonged. Children should 'have a choice' "That whole period of sedation, you always need to give more and more medication, and you start asking questions. And you say, 'What's the use of keeping this baby alive' " van Roy said. She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. That's why she's campaigning for a change to Belgium's euthanasia laws, to give the choice of ending their suffering to older children whose bodies are wracked with pain. "We want for those children to be able to talk about euthanasia and to ask those questions and if they really want to say, 'Stop, this is it, I don't want it anymore,' that they can have a choice," van Roy said. Pediatrician Gerlant van Berlae of the Free University of Brussels is among the medical professionals backing the change in the law. He told CNN that in practice it would make little difference. Ethics of euthanasia Deaf twins choose death over blindness "Doctors do terminate lives, of children as well as adults," he said. "But today it is done in, let's say, a 'gray zone,' or in the dark, because it is illegal." Pediatricians: No urgent need for this law However, 175 pediatricians signed an open letter Thursday urging more time for reflection before any decision is made. The letter argues that the law "responds to no real demand" and that most medical teams caring for terminally ill children would recognize that none of their patients has made a spontaneous and voluntary demand for euthanasia. Meanwhile, medical advances mean that effective palliative care is available and that children do not suffer as they approach death. Extending the "right to die" to minors will only add to the stress and pain of families at a difficult time, it said. The letter also questions how any objective judgment can be made on a child's ability to understand what's at stake. The political process has created a "false impression" that a change to the law is urgently needed -- but in reality "the situation in our country is far from being dramatic," the doctors say. Others also question whether children have the capacity to take this most final of decisions for themselves. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, told CNN she is concerned that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that it would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. 'If you leave, you leave forever' Izabela Sacewicz has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Having recently turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. "Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God," she says. "But if you leave, you leave forever." Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. "Do you think it's good, or not good" her mother asks. "It's not good," she replies, the words barely audible. Iwona says that with enough support, no parent would think of euthanasia -- and that Belgium's lawmakers should instead focus on providing better support for families caring for terminally ill children. Supporters insist the measure is more a matter of principle than anything else -- and that only a small number of children will ever, in practice, ask to end their lives through euthanasia. Under its strict guidelines, no doctor would be forced to carry out euthanasia against his or her will and the child would always have the option of palliative treatment. A child psychologist or psychiatrist would have to examine the child to make sure he or she is capable of making the decision. In the Netherlands, where children have been able to request euthanasia with parental consent since 2002, only five children have ever done so.</text>

<title>Euthanasia: Hope you never need it, but be glad the option is there - CNN.com</title>
<text>Euthanasia: Hope you never need it, but be glad the option is there By Dr. Philip Nitschke, pro-euthanasia advocate, Special to CNN updated 12:29 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 The controversial case of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson revived the euthanasia debate in the UK. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Belgian MPs may allow terminally ill children and those with dementia access to euthanasia Pro-euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke says debate must avoid moral panic, dogma Nitschke: If a patient's suffering cannot be relieved, what should the State do "I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws, but draw comfort from them" Editor's note: Dr. Philip Nitschke is the director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International and author of the Peaceful Pill Handbook . Follow him on Twitter @philipnitschke . The opinions expressed in this article are solely his. CNN -- The time was always going to come when society would need to face the pointy end of the voluntary euthanasia debate: Those hard cases that would challenge most people's support for the issue, the cases and circumstances which constitute never-before trodden ground. While in most Western countries polls repeatedly show strong community support for a terminally ill person's right to obtain medical assistance to die, the results would likely be quite different if the person involved was not an adult, was not of sound mind or was not, in the strictest sense, terminally ill. As Belgium decides whether to extend the right to euthanasia to those who have Alzheimer's and to children, the sharp end of the debate is staring us all in the face, regardless of where we live. The euthanasia argument is about to escalate to heights unknown: We will all be challenged about how to have a good debate, a rational debate as members of the human race, and in being challenged, we must guard against the moral panic that this issue will inevitably throw up. The issues on the table are too important for hysterical indignation and fundamental religious dogma. We are all grown-ups. The debate we are set to have -- some two decades after the world's first right to die law was passed in Australia's Northern Territory -- should be grown-up too, even if some of the stakeholders we are about to discuss are not. Historically, children and people with Alzheimer's are two segments of the community that have been viewed as having little or no agency, something that is referred to as 'capacity' in legal terms. Generally speaking, neither group has been held to be competent to make decisions that would be in their best interests. Yet this is what the Belgians are now planning. The opposite view: Euthanasia - we can live without it... For many in the ageing population, there are few fears which top that of getting dementia. Anyone who has watched a loved family member sink into the abyss of confusion and disorientation will know the utter terror that can accompany the process, as the person in question tries to juxtapose moments of clarity with the awfulness of knowing one's grip on reality -- and with it one's dignity and sense of self -- is slipping. Deaf twins choose death over blindness The case in support of euthanasia The case against assisted suicide A plea for the right to assisted suicide In New Zealand earlier this year, the Labor Member of Parliament Maryan Street paved the way with her private members bill which, if passed, would allow New Zealanders to include an assisted suicide in their Living Will. For those who may find themselves with Alzheimer's in future, this inclusion would be a valuable pre-planning tool: "If I do get dementia, at least the children will know what I want. I can now rest assured that my wishes not to live "like that" will be respected." Within the membership of Exit International , this is a common sentiment. So too is the wish not to waste government money keeping the demented elderly alive in the nation's care homes if that is not how, when they could communicate, they said they wanted to spend their last days. On the topic of children, the debate is a little easier. Some children do develop terminal illnesses and do die well before their time. It is not impossible for such young people to have a well-developed sense of their own mortality. While the Belgians will likely structure legislative developments in this area with stringent safeguards, it is the practice of forcing terminally-ill children to battle on in spite of an appalling prognosis, trying to make it to 18, that is driving the agenda. For both groups, the Belgians are bravely tackling difficulties emerging in their existing legislation, current laws that are quite obviously inadequate, even cruel, in certain circumstances. Unless modern medicine has a cure for Alzheimer's and any number of the terminal illnesses that confront children, the current situation is that they will keep suffering. If suffering cannot be relieved, the question then becomes: what should the State do Should we all be forced to live on regardless of the quality of life that confronts us Or, should legislation be extended to ensure dignity and choice for all At Exit International our motto is "a peaceful death is everybody's right." Somehow the tagline "a peaceful death is everybody's right unless you are a child or a teenager or have dementia, in which case tough luck!" doesn't have the same appeal or the same logic. The Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking and acting -- in the cold light of day, the morality of their intentions is not that challenging when the alternatives are considered. As a son to my aged mother and as a grandfather to my son's three boys, I welcome the type of society that the Belgians are proposing. Of course, I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws. But I draw great comfort from knowing they are there all the same.</text>

<sentence cont=0 >STORY HIGHLIGHTS Belgian MPs may allow terminally ill children and those with dementia access to euthanasia Pro-euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke says debate must avoid moral panic, dogma Nitschke: If a patient's suffering cannot be relieved, what should the State do "I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws, but draw comfort from them" Editor's note: Dr. Philip Nitschke is the director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International and author of the Peaceful Pill Handbook .</sentence>

<sentence cont= 0>CNN -- The time was always going to come when society would need to face the pointy end of the voluntary euthanasia debate: Those hard cases that would challenge most people's support for the issue, the cases and circumstances which constitute never-before trodden ground.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >While in most Western countries polls repeatedly show strong community support for a terminally ill person's right to obtain medical assistance to die, the results would likely be quite different if the person involved was not an adult, was not of sound mind or was not, in the strictest sense, terminally ill.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>As Belgium decides whether to extend the right to euthanasia to those who have Alzheimer's and to children, the sharp end of the debate is staring us all in the face, regardless of where we live.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>The euthanasia argument is about to escalate to heights unknown: We will all be challenged about how to have a good debate, a rational debate as members of the human race, and in being challenged, we must guard against the moral panic that this issue will inevitably throw up.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The issues on the table are too important for hysterical indignation and fundamental religious dogma.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>We are all grown-ups.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The debate we are set to have -- some two decades after the world's first right to die law was passed in Australia's Northern Territory -- should be grown-up too, even if some of the stakeholders we are about to discuss are not.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Historically, children and people with Alzheimer's are two segments of the community that have been viewed as having little or no agency, something that is referred to as 'capacity' in legal terms.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Generally speaking, neither group has been held to be competent to make decisions that would be in their best interests.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Yet this is what the Belgians are now planning.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>The opposite view: Euthanasia - we can live without it.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>For many in the ageing population, there are few fears which top that of getting dementia.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Anyone who has watched a loved family member sink into the abyss of confusion and disorientation will know the utter terror that can accompany the process, as the person in question tries to juxtapose moments of clarity with the awfulness of knowing one's grip on reality -- and with it one's dignity and sense of self -- is slipping.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Deaf twins choose death over blindness The case in support of euthanasia The case against assisted suicide A plea for the right to assisted suicide In New Zealand earlier this year, the Labor Member of Parliament Maryan Street paved the way with her private members bill which, if passed, would allow New Zealanders to include an assisted suicide in their Living Will.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >For those who may find themselves with Alzheimer's in future, this inclusion would be a valuable pre-planning tool: "If I do get dementia, at least the children will know what I want.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>I can now rest assured that my wishes not to live "like that" will be respected." Within the membership of Exit International , this is a common sentiment.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>So too is the wish not to waste government money keeping the demented elderly alive in the nation's care homes if that is not how, when they could communicate, they said they wanted to spend their last days.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>On the topic of children, the debate is a little easier.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Some children do develop terminal illnesses and do die well before their time.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >It is not impossible for such young people to have a well-developed sense of their own mortality.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>While the Belgians will likely structure legislative developments in this area with stringent safeguards, it is the practice of forcing terminally-ill children to battle on in spite of an appalling prognosis, trying to make it to 18, that is driving the agenda.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>For both groups, the Belgians are bravely tackling difficulties emerging in their existing legislation, current laws that are quite obviously inadequate, even cruel, in certain circumstances.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Unless modern medicine has a cure for Alzheimer's and any number of the terminal illnesses that confront children, the current situation is that they will keep suffering.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>If suffering cannot be relieved, the question then becomes: what should the State do Should we all be forced to live on regardless of the quality of life that confronts us Or, should legislation be extended to ensure dignity and choice for all At Exit International our motto is "a peaceful death is everybody's right." Somehow the tagline "a peaceful death is everybody's right unless you are a child or a teenager or have dementia, in which case tough luck!" doesn't have the same appeal or the same logic.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking and acting -- in the cold light of day, the morality of their intentions is not that challenging when the alternatives are considered.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>As a son to my aged mother and as a grandfather to my son's three boys, I welcome the type of society that the Belgians are proposing.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Of course, I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>But I draw great comfort from knowing they are there all the same.</sentence>

<title>Belgium: Lawmakers back allowing minors to request euthanasia - CNN.com</title>
<text>Belgium: Lawmakers back allowing minors to request euthanasia By Laura Smith-Spark and Diana Magnay, CNN updated 12:27 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 A nurse puts a respiratory mask on a baby at the Queen Fabiola Children's Hospital in Brussels on November 25, 2013. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A Belgian Senate panel votes in favor of a law extending euthanasia rights to children The bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law If passed, under-18s could request euthanasia only under stringent conditions Belgium passed a law allowing euthanasia for adults in 2002 CNN -- A controversial bill that would extend the right to request euthanasia to children suffering terminal illnesses and adults with dementia cleared a vote in a Belgian Senate committee Wednesday. The panel voted 13-4 to allow minors to seek euthanasia under certain conditions, the communications director for the Senate, Patrick Peremans, told CNN. The vote is one stage in a legislative process -- the bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law. Belgium passed legislation in 2002 allowing voluntary euthanasia for adults. Changes to the law now being considered by lawmakers would allow under-18s to request an end to their life only under stringent guidelines. Deaf twins choose death over blindness 2012: A plea for the right to assisted suicide Dr. Kenneth Chambarae, who is part of the end-of-life research group at Brussels' Free University, specializing in the impact of legalized euthanasia, said the bill explicitly states that it would be possible only for competent minors suffering unbearable physical pain from a serious physical illness without prospect of improvement to request euthanasia. This is different from adults, who can also request it if they are suffering psychologically. Chambarae argues the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else -- that very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. The bill will now be introduced in the Senate, where it will be debated in a plenary meeting by all senators, Peremans said. If the bill is voted against, this would mean the end of the measure. If it passes, the bill would then be transferred to the House of Representatives for debate. If approved there, it would go to the king to be signed into law. 'Grey zone' Earlier this month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Among them was Gerland van Berlaer, also from Brussels' Free University. "Doctors do terminate lives of children as well as adults," he told CNN. "But today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal. And this means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way." Dr. Philip Nitschke, director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International, told CNN the Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking on a very difficult issue. However, critics question whether children are capable of making an informed decision on whether to end their own lives. The Netherlands already allows children over the age of 12 to request euthanasia with the consent of their parents. Since the law was introduced in 2002, only five children have chosen to die that way.</text>

<title>Parents plead to be able to help terminally ill children die - CNN.com</title>
<text>Parents plead to be able to help terminally ill children die By Diana Magnay, CNN updated 3:39 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Belgian MPs are debating extending the law on euthanasia to terminally ill children Linda van Roy, whose baby daughter died of degenerative condition, wants law changed Supporters say euthanasia would only be chosen by very small number of minors Euthanasia opponents want more of a focus on palliative care and pain relief Interactive: Find out where euthanasia is legal around the world . Brussels, Belgium CNN -- As little Ella-Louise faded away, her tiny, frail body wracked with pain, her heartbroken mother was left to look on, feeling powerless. Linda van Roy says she could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby in the last hours of her life. "In that period, they tell you it's best not to give any fluids, because babies survive on little drops of liquid," she said. "So we stopped feeding her. In the end, it was bones and skin and no more baby left." Ten-month-old Ella-Louise died two years ago with Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system. In the final days of Ella-Louise's life, when she was being given palliative sedation, van Roy, of Schilde, Belgium, says she could still see the agony on her daughter's face. Deaf twins choose death over blindness The case in support of euthanasia The case against assisted suicide A plea for the right to assisted suicide "She died on Tuesday; on Monday, we saw on her face that she was still in pain. And then you start to get angry, because you know that there is no medication left to give her to take away that pain." She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. Unbearable suffering Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in "constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated." Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. Now, the country's lawmakers are debating a bill which would extend the "right to die" to those under the age of 18 who are terminally ill and in intolerable physical pain. The bill cleared a senate committee vote on Wednesday; it must clear several other hurdles before becoming law. Since Ella-Louise was only a baby, her case would never have qualified for euthanasia. Under the current rules, the patient must be able to make a repeated request for euthanasia themselves while experiencing unbearable suffering of which there is no prospect for improvement. But van Roy believes that children, and parents of sick babies, should have more options, including the right to choose when to die. "We want those children to be able to talk about euthanasia, and if they really want to say: 'Stop, this is it. I don't want it anymore,' we want people to have a choice," she said. Polls show the majority of Belgians agree with the principle of offering euthanasia to children. The current debate is less about whether or not to extend the legislation and more about what conditions to apply to the law: from what age euthanasia should be available and whether that should be with or without parental consent. Parental consent This month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Gerlant van Berlaer from the Free University Brussels was one of them. "Doctors do terminate the lives of children as well as adults, but today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal," he said. "This means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way." Van Berlaer stresses that only a tiny number of children would ever choose to end their lives this way: children with cancer, for example, who are still in charge of their cognitive faculties but in terrible pain. Kenneth Chambaere is a researcher at the Free University Brussels focusing on end-of-life care and euthanasia. He has compared end of life practice in Flanders before and after euthanasia was legalized in 2002, to gauge whether there has been a slippery slope. He says his research shows that although the number of euthanasia requests has gone up, from 1.1% before 2002 to 1.9% by 2008, the number of instances in which doctors have hastened the end of life without patient consent has gone down considerably. And he says minors are only a very small fraction of those deaths in any case. "People dying underage mostly die of accidents or trauma, so very sudden deaths where no end-of-life decision making is possible," he said. "And a euthanasia request is very rare in those patients." Chambaere argues that the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else; only very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. Palliative care Experiences in the Netherlands, where patients older than 12 are allowed to request euthanasia with their parents' consent, would seem to support this: Only five children have chosen to die by euthanasia since the law was introduced in 2002. But critics say children cannot reasonably decide whether to end their own lives. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, says that among the 200 children she's nursed to their deaths, she's never met a child who asked for death to come early. "The main concern for children is always for the family," she said. "It's difficult for a child, because he feels he's slipping away, but he cannot tell his parents as that's not what they want to hear. "Children say to me, 'It's not difficult to die, but please look after my parents.' " Develter worries that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that this would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. One of Sonja's patients is Izabela Sacewicz, who has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago, she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Now, having just turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. "Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God," she said. "But if you leave, you leave forever." Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. "Do you think it's good or not good" her mother asks. "It's not good." The words are barely audible. CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.

<text>Comatose woman in euthanasia debate dies Story Highlights NEW: Woman in coma for 17 years in Italy has died, her father says Eluana Englaro has been in vegetative state since a car crash Her father has fought for years to have her feeding tube removed By Alessio Vinci CNN ROME, Italy CNN -- An Italian woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose right-to-die case was being debated in the Italian Parliament has died days after doctors began removing her feeding tube. A portrait of Eluana Englaro. She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro, 37, Monday night, then called for a moment of silence in the chamber. Even as the silence ended, one legislator declared, "She has not died -- she was killed," prompting other right-to-die opponents to join in with calls of "Murderers!" Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash, when she was 20 years old. For years, Englaro's father, Beppino, fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state. Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: "Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further. I need to be left alone." But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on. When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes. Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament. Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal. Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process. A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy's Council of Ministers, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort. "I will do everything I can to save her life," Berlusconi said. "We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying." But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree. According to a statement from Napolitano's office, "An emergency decree cannot be in contrast with a court decision." The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence. Earlier this month, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that "euthanasia is a false solution to suffering." Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive. "It is the duty of the doctors, of society, and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive. No one has the right to take her life away from her," he said. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment. It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.</text>

<sentence cont= 0>He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: "Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>I need to be left alone." But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 0>Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy's Council of Ministers, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >"I will do everything I can to save her life," Berlusconi said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying." But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >According to a statement from Napolitano's office, "An emergency decree cannot be in contrast with a court decision." The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Earlier this month, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that "euthanasia is a false solution to suffering." Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>"It is the duty of the doctors, of society, and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>No one has the right to take her life away from her," he said.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment.</sentence>
<sentence cont= 1>It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.</sentence>

<title>CNN - Kevorkian charged with murder in euthanasia case - November 25, 1998</title>
<text>Kevorkian charged with murder in euthanasia case Prosecutors take doctor up on challenge Gorcyca is charging Kevorkian with murder   November 25, 1998 Web posted at: 4:12 p.m. EST 2112 GMT PONTIAC, Michigan CNN -- Setting up a high-profile legal battle over euthanasia and assisted suicide, Michigan authorities charged Dr. Jack Kevorkian with first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian was expected to turn himself in to Oakland County authorities Wednesday afternoon, and he was expected to be arraigned a short time later. Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca said he acted after viewing the raw videotape, provided by CBS, of Kevorkian injecting the patient, Thomas Youk, with a drug that killed him. An edited version was aired Sunday night on the CBS news program "60 Minutes." Gorcyca said he would seek no bond for Kevorkian, citing a past incident in which the retired pathologist appeared in court during the day and dropped off a body at the coroner's office that same night. Along with the murder charge, Kevorkian is charged with criminal assistance to a suicide and delivery of a controlled substance. Prosecutors confident of conviction Gorcyca said there was not a contradiction in charging Kevorkian with both murder and assisted suicide, and said prosecutors felt they could convict on both counts. "Not withstanding public sentiment on the issue of assisted suicide, it's incumbent upon me to make charging decisions solely on the law and not emotion or sympathy," Gorcyca said. "In this case there's an obvious violation of the law that I won't turn my back to," he said. He cited a Michigan law that went into effect this year, making it illegal to plan or participate in an assisted suicide. The prosecutor defended his decision not to charge the doctor until seeing the unedited videotape. Gorcyca had said Monday that he would not be "baited" into a charge without having all the evidence. "It was vital that a decision be made only after all the facts were known," he said. Gorcyca also told reporters several times that it would make no difference that Houck wanted to die. "Consent is not a viable defense in taking a life of another, even under the most controlled environment," he said. "I doubt there will come a case where there presents itself such convincing evidence of these crimes as depicted on videotape and in conjunction with admissions to having committed these crimes," Gorcyca said. "Our proofs are strong." Kevorkian dared prosecutors to charge him Kevorkian at an earlier trial on charges stemming from assisted suicide   Kevorkian staged the "60 Minutes" interview in hopes that authorities would charge him and force a legal showdown over assisted suicide and euthanasia. He told CBS' Mike Wallace if he was held in jail he would go on a hunger strike. He already has been acquitted at three earlier trials. In an interview with the Oakland Press published Monday, Kevorkian said he would give Gorcyca a week to take action. "Either charge me within a week, or I will resume my practice, and resist with all my power any attempt to arrest or hinder me," he told the paper. The 70-year-old retired pathologist has admitted helping more than 130 people end their lives. But Kevorkian said it was the first time he himself had directly administered the fatal dose. In Sunday night's broadcast, reporter Mike Wallace asked Kevorkian, "You killed him" "I did," Kevorkian replied. "But it could be manslaughter, not murder. It's not necessarily murder. But it doesn't bother me what you call it. I know what it is. This could never be a crime in any society which deems itself enlightened." During the "60 Minutes" broadcast, Youk's family said he had suffered terrible pain from his disease. "I was so grateful to know that someone would relieve him of his suffering," Youk's wife, Melody, said. "I don't consider it murder. I consider it the way things should be." The family had written to Kevorkian, who videotaped his first meeting with them. That videotape was also broadcast by "60 Minutes" and showed Kevorkian explaining to Youk what he wanted to do, then asking for and receiving his written consent. "I had him sign a thing that he chose direct injection, and he signed it," Kevorkian said. He said he felt sure he did not force Youk to agree. Reuters contributed to this report.

<title>CNN.com - Spanish film put focus on euthanasia - Mar 23, 2005</title>
<text>Spanish film put focus on euthanasia By CNN's Al Goodman Ramon Sampedro was played in the film by actor Javier Bardem. VIDEO The political and rhetorical lines drawn in the battle over Terri Schiavo may not be as clear as they appear. Manage alerts | What is this MADRID, Spain CNN -- The film "Mar Adentro" -- or "The Sea Inside" -- tells the true story of a quadriplegic who wanted to end his life, and in the process became Spain's most famous case of euthanasia. The movie asks: Did this man, Ramon Sampedro, have the right to say his life belonged to him, and no-one else Director Alejandro Amenabar said: "What we wanted to show was that this man, after 30 years, decides he wants to die and he doesn't seem to us like someone who was unstable, as some people have suggested." Ramon Sampedro was paralyzed below the neck in a diving accident. He was able to smoke only if someone put a cigarette in his mouth, as depicted in the film. He learned how to write holding a pen between his teeth. And he went to court to ask for the right to commit assisted suicide. His plea was rejected. But he got friends to help anyway. In January 1998, he was videotaped drinking poison -- and making his final statement: "You have liberated me from the most humiliating of slaveries, being a live head stuck to a dead body." Socialist party official Matilde Valentin says there are no plans to legalize assisted suicide in Spain -- but nor does she agree with the way the Schiavo case has been handled. "Suddenly the president and the Congress pass a law to change the legal situation. These hurried decisions, without consensus, can't solve the problem," he said. Various opinion polls in the past decade have shown a majority of Spaniards favor decriminalizing assisted suicide. In one poll even a majority of Spanish doctors say terminally ill patients should have the option of euthanasia. On the streets of Madrid, the consensus seems to be against prolonging life unnaturally. The Catholic Church says that God's will must be allowed to prevail. Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, of the Spanish Bishops Conference, said: "The position of the church is that death cannot be provoked. Nor can it be absurdly delayed. Death has its time -- its natural time." Ramon Sampedro chose his time. Terri Schiavo has no such power. Story Tools</text>

<topic>federal reserve</topic>
<title>CNN.com - Federal Reserve wars - Nov.  7, 2003</title>
<text>Robert Novak is a nationally syndicated columnist. Federal Reserve wars Story Tools WASHINGTON Creators Syndicate -- Behind the Federal Reserve's decision last week to make no change in monetary policy were two momentous developments inside this most secretive government institution. First, Chairman Alan Greenspan, nearing the end of his protracted tenure, reasserted control after recent shaky performances. Second, an ideological struggle began inside the central bank that could influence the U.S. economy far into the future. Greenspan's strength was seen in the Federal Open Market Committee's FOMC decision October 27 to not only retain low short-term rates but keep them for a "considerable period" -- despite the desire of the Fed's influential staff to eliminate those two words. That also represented movement toward an "inflation standard" in determining monetary policy, diminishing power of future Fed chairmen and bureaucrats. Although today's Federal Reserve is almost transparent when compared with its opaque past, what goes on behind closed doors in its marble palace remains cloaked in mystery. The events last week were especially shrouded by Greenspan's desire to avoid the impression of controversy in his final years and an important doctrinal debate between two remarkable new Fed governors. These two governors both took office August 5, 2002, ending years of humdrum appointments to the central bank that reflected Greenspan's wishes. One new governor was Ben Bernanke, the 48-year-old chairman of Princeton University's economics department and the most distinguished economic theorist on the Federal Reserve Board in recent memory. Bernanke was a rare Fed nomination originated in the White House, not by Greenspan. The other new governor was 59-year-old Donald Kohn, a Fed staffer for 35 years and Greenspan's right-hand man the last 15. Bernanke has long advocated setting inflation targets to determine whether the central bank should tighten or loosen. Not wishing to offend Greenspan, the rookie governor has argued that this will help the next chairman, who would lack the magical finesse of "the maestro." An inflation standard would threaten the central bank's aura of mystery and its world-famous staff's actual power. Kohn, who did not become only the third member of the Fed's bureaucracy ever to be a governor just to preside over its diminution, opposes targeting inflation. Bernanke vs. Kohn is no mere theoretical debate. Greenspan, blamed by Republicans for contributing to the first George Bush's 1992 defeat by tightening money, does not want to doom re-election chances of the second President Bush by snuffing out the recovery -- particularly after the president extended his tenure to 2006. Kohn and the Fed staff want to tighten whenever the economy grows -- the old Phillips Curve -- even if inflation continues to fall, as is now happening. A showdown was set for the FOMC meeting of October 27. On October 23, Washington Post reporter John M. Berry wrote that Fed policymakers were not only going to retain the low 1 percent overnight rate but "are also likely" to repeat their September statement that rates would stay low for a "considerable period." What Berry writes is seen in financial circles as Greenspan gospel. However, a long article on the October 27 front page of the Wall Street Journal by Greg Ip revealed strong opposition inside the FOMC to those two little words. That was seen as the voice of Governor Kohn and the Fed bureaucracy. Money markets were in doubt. In July, Berry had signaled the FOMC would reduce the overnight rate by 50 basis points, down to .75 percent. But Ip reported the cut would be only 25 basis points -- reflecting the powerful Fed staff's caution. At the July meeting, Greenspan was passive and the staff prevailed. The results were temporarily devastating, with long-term interest rates rising and stock prices falling. To prevent calamitous long-term effects, Greenspan did not let history repeat itself in October. The "considerable period" statement, implicitly targeting inflation instead of growth, was retained. One veteran Fed-watcher called it "a manhood issue" for the chairman. Beyond Greenspan's manhood and even George W. Bush's re-election lies America's economic future. No rookie Fed governor has ever been so ideologically adept as Kohn, who until now has kept under cover his theoretical dispute with Bernanke. Greenspan is reported to have no objection to targeting inflation, but only after he leaves the Fed. If this happens, there may never be another Greenspan -- a small price for a more stable economy.

<title>Growing opposition puts Bernanke approval in question - CNN.com</title>
<text>Growing opposition puts Bernanke approval in question From Dana Bash, CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Ben Bernanke was approved by the Senate Banking Committee last month. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ben Bernanke's term as Federal Reserve chairman expires January 31 He was approved by Senate Banking Committee last month Top Senate Democrats say they will not support Bernanke for second term Obama spokesman says president is standing behind Bernanke Washington CNN -- A second term for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke became more uncertain Friday as two leading liberal senators announced that they will vote no, and many other Senate Democrats said they are undecided. Sens. Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, issued statements announcing their opposition to Bernanke. "Under the watch of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve permitted grossly irresponsible financial activities that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression," Feingold said. "Under Chairman Bernanke's watch, predatory mortgage lending flourished, and 'too big to fail' financial giants were permitted to engage in activities that put our nation's economy at risk." Boxer said she's voting no because Bernanke "played a lead role in crafting the Bush administration's economic policies, which led to the current economic crisis." "Our next Federal Reserve chairman must represent a clean break from the failed policies of the past," she said. Democratic concern about Bernanke boiled over in an all-Democrat private lunch Wednesday, the day after the party lost a Massachusetts Senate seat. A senior Democratic source familiar with meeting said it got "raucous" as several senators stood and voiced opposition to confirming Bernanke for another term. The party's Senate vote counter, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that enough Democrats have stated either outright opposition or deep concern to indicate that heavy reliance on GOP votes will be needed to approve Bernanke again. "I just think there is some uncertainty here, and we don't know from the Republican side whether they can provide votes," Durbin said. Video: Obama calls for banking reform RELATED TOPICS Democratic Party Bernanke does have some bipartisan support. Four Republicans joined Democrats in voting yes in the Senate Banking Committee last month. The Senate would need 60 votes to approve Bernanke to overcome opposition from several members, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, who is leading the charge against him. When Bernanke was confirmed for his first term in 2006 under President George W. Bush, there was no opposition. The Senate approved his nomination by unanimous consent. Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, who said he will vote for Bernanke, said he believes that the anti-Wall Street fervor that senators are hearing from constituents -- and that played a role in the Massachusetts vote this week -- is having an effect. "The Tuesday election results have caused a little angst," Baucus said. Durbin tried to downplay the effect the Massachusetts loss is having on Bernanke's fate. "We have a number of Democrats who have already said they are not going to support him," he said. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said she has not decided how she will vote. "Like everyone else, I have serious concerns about what happened in the past. On the other hand, he's had to basically steer us through this crisis, and I have found him to be honest in hearings, so I am going to look at the whole record," Klobuchar said. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he is undecided about Bernanke, too. "I am cogitating on it right now," he said. Harkin said he has deep concerns about Bernanke's performance "during the period of time when these investment banks were running amok." "I just have some uneasy feelings that his mindset is not where we need to be in terms of the Federal Reserve right now," Harkin said. "He has a lot of baggage he carries." Asked whether he has gotten any calls from the White House pressuring him to vote in favor of Bernanke, Harkin said no and then joked, "After this interview, I will." The White House is up against a tight timetable. Bernanke's term runs out January 31. Aboard Air Force One en route to Ohio, where Obama appeared at a town hall meeting, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs emphasized that the president is standing by his decision to renominate the Bush-era Fed chief. "He has a great deal in confidence in what Chairman Bernanke did to bring our economy back from the brink. And he continues to think that he's the best person for the job and will be confirmed by the United States Senate," Gibbs said. Share this on:</text>

<sentence cont=0 >STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ben Bernanke's term as Federal Reserve chairman expires January 31 He was approved by Senate Banking Committee last month Top Senate Democrats say they will not support Bernanke for second term Obama spokesman says president is standing behind Bernanke Washington CNN -- A second term for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke became more uncertain Friday as two leading liberal senators announced that they will vote no, and many other Senate Democrats said they are undecided.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Sens.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Russ Feingold, D-Wisconsin, and Barbara Boxer, D-California, issued statements announcing their opposition to Bernanke.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Under the watch of Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve permitted grossly irresponsible financial activities that led to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression," Feingold said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Under Chairman Bernanke's watch, predatory mortgage lending flourished, and 'too big to fail' financial giants were permitted to engage in activities that put our nation's economy at risk." Boxer said she's voting no because Bernanke "played a lead role in crafting the Bush administration's economic policies, which led to the current economic crisis." "Our next Federal Reserve chairman must represent a clean break from the failed policies of the past," she said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Democratic concern about Bernanke boiled over in an all-Democrat private lunch Wednesday, the day after the party lost a Massachusetts Senate seat.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >A senior Democratic source familiar with meeting said it got "raucous" as several senators stood and voiced opposition to confirming Bernanke for another term.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The party's Senate vote counter, Dick Durbin of Illinois, said that enough Democrats have stated either outright opposition or deep concern to indicate that heavy reliance on GOP votes will be needed to approve Bernanke again.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"I just think there is some uncertainty here, and we don't know from the Republican side whether they can provide votes," Durbin said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Video: Obama calls for banking reform RELATED TOPICS Democratic Party Bernanke does have some bipartisan support.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Four Republicans joined Democrats in voting yes in the Senate Banking Committee last month.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Senate would need 60 votes to approve Bernanke to overcome opposition from several members, including Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, who is leading the charge against him.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >When Bernanke was confirmed for his first term in 2006 under President George W.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Bush, there was no opposition.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Senate approved his nomination by unanimous consent.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus of Montana, who said he will vote for Bernanke, said he believes that the anti-Wall Street fervor that senators are hearing from constituents -- and that played a role in the Massachusetts vote this week -- is having an effect.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The Tuesday election results have caused a little angst," Baucus said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Durbin tried to downplay the effect the Massachusetts loss is having on Bernanke's fate.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We have a number of Democrats who have already said they are not going to support him," he said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Sen.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, said she has not decided how she will vote.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Like everyone else, I have serious concerns about what happened in the past.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >On the other hand, he's had to basically steer us through this crisis, and I have found him to be honest in hearings, so I am going to look at the whole record," Klobuchar said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he is undecided about Bernanke, too.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"I am cogitating on it right now," he said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Harkin said he has deep concerns about Bernanke's performance "during the period of time when these investment banks were running amok." "I just have some uneasy feelings that his mindset is not where we need to be in terms of the Federal Reserve right now," Harkin said.</sentence>
<sentence cont1= >"He has a lot of baggage he carries." Asked whether he has gotten any calls from the White House pressuring him to vote in favor of Bernanke, Harkin said no and then joked, "After this interview, I will." The White House is up against a tight timetable.</sentence>

<title>Social Security combats bullet rumors - CNN.com</title>
<text>Social Security combats bullet rumors By Lateef Mungin and Michael Pearson, CNN updated 5:41 AM EDT, Wed September 5, 2012 The Social Security Administration posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow-point bullets last month. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Some question the Social Security Administration's recent bid request for 174,000 hollow-point bullets Bloggers say the agency's police force is preparing for financial collapse and civil unrest The agency characterizes the order as routine and says special agents need them "These investigators have full law enforcement authority," the agency says CNN -- Praise the Internet and pass the ammunition: the blogosphere is roiling with conspiracy theories over a Social Security Administration shopping list for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Depending on whom you believe, police who protect Social Security Administration officers are either preparing for impending financial doom by purchasing lethal ammo to put down rioting citizens, or they're just making a standard purchase of ammunition for a federal police agency. It all began last month when the agency, which is primarily responsible for distributing benefits to the disabled and retired people, posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Why cried some bloggers. Infowars, a website operated by right-wing talk show host Alex Jones, wanted to know if the agency was preparing for "civil unrest." When to take Social Security "Social Security welfare is estimated to keep around 40 per cent of senior citizens out of poverty. Should the tap run dry in the aftermath of an economic collapse which the Federal Reserve has already told top banks to prepare for, domestic disorder could ensue if people are refused their benefits," it said in a post . Each bullet potentially "represents a dead American," wrote retired Maj. Gen. Jerry Curry , an Army vet. "If so, why would the U.S. government want the SSA to kill 174,000 of our citizens, even during a time of civil unrest" Curry wrote on the conservative website The Daily Caller, founded by commentator Tucker Carlson. Conspiracy theorists had previously speculated that a purchase of hollow-point bullets by the Department of Homeland Security was similarly meant to quell impending riots. A few years ago, theorists similarly questioned why the Federal Emergency Management Agency was stockpiling body bags and other supplies, suggesting the agency was preparing for civil collapse. In the face of the furor, the Social Security Administration's public affairs shop -- which spends most of its time issuing releases about speeding disability decisions or looking up benefits information -- issued a statement explaining that its 295 agents need the bullets for target practice and to protect the agency's 66 offices across the nation. "These investigators have full law enforcement authority, including executing search warrants and making arrests," the agency said in an August post . "Our investigators are similar to your state or local police officers. They use traditional investigative techniques, and they are armed when on official duty." Hollow point bullets are standard-issue items for many police agencies, the Social Security Administration said. The bullets expand when they hit a target and can help prevent injuries to bystanders from bullets passing through a body, according to police. Investigators "use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions, to ensure agent and public safety," the administration added. This is just the latest in a long history of uniquely American anti-government conspiracy theories, said Kathryn Olmsted, a University of California at Davis history professor and author of "Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories in American Democracy." That another one would surface in the midst of a contentious election cycle and continued unease over the nation's financial future is not all that surprising, Olmsted said Tuesday. But this one, she said, seems particularly tenuous. "It strikes me as one of the more extreme conspiracy theories," Olmsted said. "I'm surprised it has any traction." Yet it does. "You don't use hollow point bullets for target practice," one Twitter user posted Tuesday. "Sorry we're not buying it social security agency. #youarefullofit."</text>

<title>Opinion: To get something done, put a woman in charge - CNN.com</title>
<text>Men dither while women lead in the world By Hanna Rosin, Special to CNN updated 1:35 PM EDT, Fri October 11, 2013 Federal Reserve nominee Janet Yellen could show male leaders a thing or two about getting things done, Hanna Rosin says. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hanna Rosin: A leader guiding a nation to prosperity Obama No, Angela Merkel in Germany She says news full of dithering male leaders, while a woman has been picked to head the Fed She says competence in global leadership belongs to women like IMF chief Christine Lagarde Rosin: This may be the week when the world realizes women are better at the helm Editor's note: Hanna Rosin is the author of " The End of Men: And the Rise of Women ," now out in paperback. She is co-founder of Slate's DoubleX , a Web magazine about women issues. CNN -- This important leader handles the debt crisis with grace, navigating expertly between austerity and growth. The leader's opponents grumble, more out of jealousy than genuine opposition, and loyal supporters hail the leader as a hero. The leader's popularity soars; re-election is not in question. Meanwhile, unemployment is at an all-time low, and the leader's nation is looking like its own island of prosperity, a beacon to a suffering continent. For President Barack Obama, this is a daydream. For German Chancellor Angela Merkel, this is life. Funny how the most admired leader of the Western world right now, the clearest example we have of consistent success during trying times, is a woman. Hanna Rosin The pictures in the news, day after day, tell the story: House Speaker John Boehner looks like he hasn't slept in weeks. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell looks like he swallowed a lemon. Sen. Ted Cruz looks bizarrely smug while the world crumbles around him, and Obama can only shake his head and loosen his collar. The only Washington type who was smiling on the front page of the newspaper this week was Janet Yellen, newly nominated by Obama to be the chair of the Federal Reserve, and anointed by one observer as the most powerful woman in world history. Oh, and there was one other person smiling in Washington: Christine Lagarde, chief of the International Monetary Fund, who was in the U.S. capital for the organization's annual meeting and who said just about the only sensible thing anyone in town has said all week on the debt ceiling crisis: "I hope that in a few weeks' time, we will look back and say, 'What a waste of time that was.' " This has not been a shining week for the patriarchy. The men in suits dither, posture, plan negotiation sessions and then cancel them, and employ copious military metaphors -- "wage battle," "refuse to surrender" -- to no effect. Increasingly they become associated in the minds of the American people with verbs normally used to describe toddlers, such as "tantrum" or "throw a fit." Malala on the Nobel Peace Prize Janet Yellen: 'Small lady with large IQ' Lagarde on European 'green shoots' Competence, meanwhile belongs to the women, particularly in the usually macho world of global finance. Over in Europe, Merkel was re-elected on the basis of her deft handling of the eurozone crisis, and in the United States, monetary policy was entrusted to Yellen. Making the victory extra sweet for women, she was chosen instead of Lawrence Summers, who will forever be remembered for saying women aren't that good at math. And this moment of female triumph extends beyond mere competence to unfathomable bravery. The hero of the moment -- the person who has been shot at, nearly killed and is still not afraid to talk -- is a heroine: 16-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who was nominated for a Nobel Prize and who told Jon Stewart this week that if she were faced with a Taliban gunman such as the one who shot her last year she would, once again, explain to him how important education is for girls. In response Stewart asked if he could adopt her. Perhaps this will be remembered as the week when everything shifted, when we realized that leaving groups of men in charge of global decisions and of facing down terrorists is not a good idea, and we'd better calmly hand the reins over to the women. Don't laugh. It happened in Iceland . Lagarde described the transfer of power recently on a panel at the Clinton Global Initiative. She explained how women brought Iceland out of its recession. After the economy crashed, "the banks, the funds, the government -- everything was taken over by women," she told The Wall Street Journal . "So when it's messy, you get the women in. But when the mess is sorted," she added, "keep the women."</text>

<title>Ron Paul: 'Monetary system is fraudulent' - CNN.com</title>
<text>It was all seen there but now he says if we could have only had more regulations ... Roberts: Right. Paul: ... we could have salvaged this clogged system. Roberts: Well, you believe that markets can be or should be self-regulating Paul: Well, to a degree, but the government does have a responsibility to deal with fraud, but the monetary system is fraudulent. Instead of perpetuating fraud in the monetary system they should be dealing with real fraud. But just regulating prices -- that's what they're doing now, they're trying to regulate prices and set prices for these assets that hasn't -- have no value. So, no, that's not the kind of regulation we want, but there is certainly a role for regulations. We should be regulating the Federal Reserve system is what we really ought to be regulating. Roberts: Well, regardless of what we talk about this morning, the Dow is going to go off a cliff again today so let me turn to politics if I could. A lot of people have said, particularly because of the economy, this is a bad year to be a Republican. John McCain behind in the national polls, seems to be behind in the battleground states as well. He's got a long and difficult road if he hopes to win the Oval Office. If Republicans really take a beating, Congressman Paul, on November the 4th, where does that leave the Republican brand Paul: Well, I think they're in big trouble, but I think I mentioned that a year or so ago, that they've sort of lost their way. No, it's going to be a lot worse, but you have to say that the markets aren't being reassured about the obvious victory that's going to occur. Then they said, "Oh, my, you know, we're going to have Obama and a Democratic Congress stronger than ever so things are going to get a lot better." They haven't discounted that yet. The country is in a mess regardless, but I think the Republican Party really in a mess because ... Roberts: I mean, I mean how ... Paul: ... they'll probably lose a fair amount of seats again. Roberts: How bad a blow could it be and how long might it take the party to rebuild Paul: You know, I was first elected -- I first ran in 1974, and I think there were about 145 members of Congress, Republicans, then. It took 20 years. So that is the case. But, you know, I think it's secondary to what the Congress is doing. If both parties have bad ideas, it doesn't matter a whole lot. Right now ... Roberts: And I wanted to ask you about ... Paul: ... I think both parties follow those ideas. Roberts: You're on the ballot in a couple of states. You're on the ballot in Louisiana. You're also on the ballot in Montana, and in Montana you were polling 4 percent there. That's exactly the difference between Senator McCain and Barack Obama with Barack Obama on top. I mean you could be the spoiler here and take Montana away from Senator McCain, and I know that some Republicans, friendly to you, say hey, get off the ballot in Montana. You tried, you couldn't. How are you going to feel if because of you McCain loses Montana Paul: Well, I think it will be a pretty far stretch if McCain loses the election that they're going to blame me. I haven't been campaigning in Montana. People who are supporting out there are spontaneous. They're enthusiastic. They don't like either candidate. So I don't think the person whose name they picked is the one that does the spoiling. I think there's something else that is wrong. Maybe it's the flawed policies of both candidates. Roberts: Congressman Paul, it's always good to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning. We'll check back with you again soon. Paul: Thank you. Good to be with you.</text>

<text>Four years after Dodd-Frank fix, system still broken By Patrick McHenry updated 1:49 PM EDT, Mon July 21, 2014 Four years after the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law's enactment, problems remain in the financial system, critics say. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Rep. Patrick McHenry: Wall Street reform law isn't working four years after enactment He says Dodd-Frank law has imposed billions in costs and millions of hours of extra work McHenry argues it is another example of big government overreach Editor's note: Rep. Patrick McHenry, a Republican, is in his fifth term representing North Carolina's 10th Congressional District. He was recently selected as chief deputy whip and also is on the House Financial Services Committee, where he is chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- In 2007 and 2008, the American economy suffered through its greatest crisis since the Great Depression. The Treasury Department estimates that from 2007 to 2009, the heart of the Great Recession, more than 8.8 million American jobs disappeared and more than $19 trillion in household wealth was lost. In response to the crisis, the federal government took steps to reform our financial system, most significantly, passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Signed into law by President Barack Obama four years ago Monday, this bill was designed to improve accountability and transparency in our financial system, ensuring we never again face a financial crisis of this magnitude. Regrettably, Dodd-Frank has done little to address the root causes of this crisis. Instead, by institutionalizing bailouts and undermining a competitive and fair marketplace, this law has joined Obamacare as another example of big government overreach that has ultimately done more harm than good for the American people. Rep. Patrick McHenry Wall Street reform law only half done At 849 pages, Dodd-Frank touches nearly every aspect of our financial system, from capital ratios of large financial institutions down to new rules on the credit cards most Americans have in their wallets. Dodd-Frank has only grown larger since Obama signed it. Much of the statutory text tasks Washington bureaucrats with writing nearly 400 rules. As of the first of this month, law firm Davis Polk reported 45% of rulemaking deadlines have been missed. Since its enactment, Dodd-Frank has imposed $21.8 billion in compliance costs while producing regulations that require nearly 60 million hours of paperwork with which to comply, according to estimates by the American Action Forum , a center-right policy institute. Dodd-Frank and JPMorgan's losses These compliance costs can be devastating to small community banks and credit unions. Often they are the only financial institutions serving small towns and rural areas such as those throughout my district in western North Carolina. Assuming these small institutions can withstand this Dodd-Frank-induced regulatory onslaught and stay in business, they will join larger banks in passing these added costs along to consumers, driving up the cost of borrowing and reducing access to much-needed credit. Among the great indignities of the financial crisis: American families were footing the bill for the massive taxpayer-funded bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other large financial institutions while struggling to scrape by in the broken economy. In 2009, Bloomberg estimated that the U.S. government and other federal agencies had committed nearly $13 trillion to support these failing institutions. The nearly $13 trillion represented 90% of the U.S. gross domestic product for 2008. In signing the law, Obama claimed that never again would the American people foot the bill for these large firms. Yet amazingly Dodd-Frank does not just fail to end these bailouts, it cements them into law and greatly increases the likelihood the American people will be stuck with the federal government's bailout tab again in the future. View my Flipboard Magazine. In addition to an alphabet soup of new agencies, such as FSOC Financial Stability Oversight Council and OFR Office of Financial Research , Dodd-Frank also gave us the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a uniquely some might say dangerously unaccountable addition to our federal bureaucracy. Designed with the noble goal of consumer protection, the agency was given significant power to regulate financial offerings but was designed in a manner to leave it free of oversight from both the White House and Congress. Among the agency's "accomplishments" is its qualified mortgage rule that has negatively affected credit availability in the mortgage market. The rule has especially harmed those who have typically struggled to access credit in the past, women and minorities. A recent report from the Federal Reserve Board showed roughly one-third of black and Hispanic borrowers would not qualify for mortgages under the rule. Even more troubling is the bureau's latest project, the National Mortgage Database . In an apparent effort to make the National Security Agency jealous, this database will track individual Americans and their personally identifiable information, including the most intimate personal and financial details, going back as far as 30 years. And this does not even begin to address the consumer agency's management failures that have led to claims of discrimination and retaliation against minority employees going unpunished and spending $216 million to renovate its rented office space . Put simply, Dodd-Frank is but another failed big government "reform" -- just like Obamacare, the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and the stimulus. When will this administration realize more government does not solve problems, it is the problem</text>

<title>Stop subsidizing soaring college costs - CNN.com</title>
<text>Stop subsidizing soaring college costs By William J. Bennett, CNN Contributor updated 2:56 PM EDT, Thu March 22, 2012 Should taxpayers continue to subsidize rising college costs STORY HIGHLIGHTS William Bennett: Increases in federal financial aid don't seem to improve college affordability Bennett: Taxpayers subsidize higher education, but institutions' performances haven't kept up He says student loan indebtedness could be the next U.S. debt bomb Bennett: Colleges need to keep costs down, or else taxpayers should stop the funding Editor's note: William J. Bennett, a CNN contributor, is the author of " The Book of Man: Readings on the Path to Manhood ." He was U.S. secretary of education from 1985 to 1988 and director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George H.W. Bush. CNN -- The cost of college tuition will continue to rise as long as federal student aid programs continue to increase with little or no accountability. That was the hypothesis now known in education circles as the Bennett Hypothesis of a column I wrote for The New York Times in 1987, in response to tuition hikes at many of the nation's colleges and universities. I had noticed an interesting phenomenon: Increases in federal financial aid were not improving college affordability. Each year, federal financial aid outlays would increase, but college tuitions would continue to rise above and beyond the rate of inflation. Much like the effects of subsidies on health care and the housing market, increasing student aid was insulating colleges from having to make market-driven cost-cutting measures, like improving productivity or efficiency. It appears that this may still be true today. William Bennett Last month, Andrew Gillen at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity authored a new paper introducing the " Bennett Hypothesis 2.0 ," an updated version of my original argument. Under the current financial aid system, he concluded, "As higher financial aid pushes costs higher, it inevitably puts upward pressure on tuition. Higher tuition, of course, reduces college affordability, leading to calls for more financial aid, setting the vicious cycle in motion all over again." In 1987, I reached my hypothesis by examining the basic relationship between federal financial aid and tuition. Let's compare the numbers today. In 2010, the Department of Education distributed $133 billion in student aid. In 2011, it was nearly $157 billion, a 17% increase. Pell Grants increased from $29 billion in 2010 to $36 billion in 2011, a 24% increase. At the same time, in 2011, costs at the average public university rose 5.4% for in-state students , or about $1,100. Average tuition at public universities rose 8.3%. The increases have greatly outpaced the rate of inflation , which was 3% in 2011. While increased federal aid does not cause college price inflation, it can be a considerable factor. Many other elements influence tuition prices, such as the rise of alumni donations, the expansions of institutional services and the ever-increasing demand for higher education. Families will go to incredible, and often insane, lengths to get their son or daughter into college, and these institutions know that. Nevertheless, the federal mechanism intended to make college more affordable seems to be having little or no effect. Furthermore, taxpayers are getting fewer returns for their money. In 2009, the six-year graduation rate of bachelor's students was 56% in the United States. In 1997, it was 52%. During that time period, student aid skyrocketed. According to the College Board , "Total student aid increased by about 84% in inflation-adjusted dollars over the decade from 1997-98 to 2007-08." Taxpayers are subsidizing higher education at greater and greater costs while institutional performance has not kept up. This gap between enrollment and graduation costs the U.S. economy millions of dollars in potential earnings each year and expands the growing student loan bubble. Weighed down by rising tuition costs, students borrow more money each year to pay for college. The more they borrow, the more difficult it becomes for them to pay for college on their own or in a timely manner, and if they fail to graduate, they are left holding larger piles of debt. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, student loan indebtedness reached $867 billion last year. By comparison, outstanding U.S. credit card debt was $704 billion. And almost 15% of all borrowers have at least one past-due loan account. There are legitimate fears that this could be the next U.S. debt bomb. Why should taxpayers continue to increase funding for federal aid programs that do little to control soaring college costs and rein in student debt Like the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, the middle class would be crushed by a mass student loan default. Our students and their families deserve better than this. As I said 25 years ago, "Higher education is not underfunded. It is under-accountable." Federal aid should be closely tied to academic performance, graduation rates and the ability of students to repay their loans in a responsible manner. During his State of the Union address this year, President Obama said, "We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition." He added, "So let me put colleges and universities on notice. If you can't stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down." It's encouraging to see the president acknowledge what has long been the argument of conservative education reformers. It remains to be seen if his threat holds any weight and if he will act on it.

<title>Poll: Majority against free trade - CNN.com</title>
<text>Poll: Majority against free trade Story Highlights New CNN/Opinion Research Corp. Poll released Tuesday It suggests the free trade issue may pose a problem for McCain Poll: 51 percent of Americans view foreign trade as a threat to the economy From Alexander Mooney CNN CNN -- As Sen. John McCain prepares to promote free trade during a high-profile trip to Colombia and Mexico, a poll out Tuesday suggests the issue may be a political hurdle as the general election campaign heats up. Sen. John McCain's free trade stance could pose a problem in November, according to a new poll. According to the CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, 51 percent of Americans view foreign trade as a threat to the economy -- the first time in a CNN poll that a majority of Americans report holding negative views on free trade. That compares with only 35 percent of Americans who felt free trade posed a threat to the economy in 2000, and 48 percent who felt it was a threat in 2006. Now, only four in 10 Americans say free trade presents an opportunity for economic growth, a sentiment that clearly makes the issue a challenge for McCain , especially in the crucial Rust Belt states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last decade. "It's possible that John McCain's decision to highlight his free trade position may wind up losing him some votes among Americans who feel threatened economically by competition from other countries," CNN polling director Keating Holland said. "Recent polls in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have shown McCain well behind Barack Obama . Calling attention to his stand on an issue like trade may be a part of the problems he apparently faces in those Midwestern states." The poll also shows that some of the key voting blocs McCain is courting are most against free trade . Women, older Americans and lower-income voters report feeling the biggest threat from unfettered trade. Many of these voters were particularly receptive to Sen. Hillary Clinton in key states during the Democratic primary as she increasingly developed an anti-trade stance. Don't Miss CNN Election Center: Free Trade issue The survey results come as McCain, who is a strong supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement , heads to Colombia and Mexico to promote the advantages off a free trade policy and economic cooperation. He made a similar trip to Canada earlier this month. Campaigning Monday through Pennsylvania -- one of the crucial political battleground states most affected by the loss of manufacturing jobs -- the presumptive Republican presidential nominee acknowledged many voters disagree with him on the issue. "I understand it's very tough. But for me to give up my advocacy of free trade would be a betrayal of trust," he told reporters Tuesday. "And the most precious commodity I have with the American people is that they trust me." In another challenge for McCain, the new CNN survey indicates Americans continue to rank the economy as the most important issue in deciding their vote for president. Nearly six in 10 voters say the country's poor economic conditions will be extremely important -- ranking the economy as the No. 1 issue in this campaign out of 15 issues tested in the poll. That finding represents a clear change from the beginning of this year, when the war in Iraq and the economy were tied as the top campaign issues. Now, the economy is eight points ahead of Iraq -- a fact that could pose a threat to McCain, who has admitted he is more comfortable discussing foreign policy issues than economic ones. Rising gas prices are also among voters' concerns, with nearly 50 percent saying the issue will play an important role in their vote for president. That number is just behind those that say the economy and Iraq are important, a clear sign that higher prices for gasoline are the primary reason for voters' economic worries, though not the only one. "It also means that a significant number of voters are concerned about other economic woes, like the stock market or unemployment, rather than gas prices," Holland said. "Unless there is a noticeable upturn in the country's economy between now and November, this election is likely to be dominated by economic concerns." The poll, conducted June 26-29, surveyed 906 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</text>

<title>The mystical power of free trade - December 13, 1999</title>
<text>The mystical power of free trade Some people find it hard to believe it really works, but it does By Michael Kinsley December 6, 1999 Web posted at: 1:27 p.m. EST 1827 GMT Free trade is always a hard sell. In all of social science, the proposition that comes closest to being scientific, in terms of being theoretically provable and true in real life, is that a society benefits from allowing its citizens to buy what they wish--even from foreigners. But people resist this conclusion, sometimes violently, as in Seattle last week. Why A couple of reasons. First, the principle of free trade may be true, but it's not obviously true. In fact, it's counterintuitive. If a factory shuts down because of a flood of cheap foreign products, how is that good If middle-class Americans find themselves competing with foreigners being paid practically nothing and living in squalor, how can this send Americans' standard of living up and not down If another nation is willing to pollute its air and water in order to produce goods for sale in the global economy, how can America join that economy and still hope to keep its own air and water clean There are answers to these questions, but they take a bit of background and a bit of persuading. Students of economics are led step by step through layers of reasoning until the moment they see the light. Skeptics think that the whole routine is like induction into a religious cult and that free trade is more like an article of religious faith than a sound policy recommendation. These skeptics are wrong, but their skepticism is understandable. The other reason it's hard to sell free trade is that any given example tends to benefit a lot of people in small ways that are hard to identify and tends to harm a few people a lot in ways that are vividly evident. When that factory shuts down, the unemployed workers know they've suffered a loss, and they know why. And it's a big enough loss to stir them politically. It will affect their vote at least, if not cause them to march in the streets. By contrast, budget-conscious clothes shoppers maybe those same workers who are able to save a few bucks on a new sweater are not likely to realize they are enjoying a bargain as a result of global trade or to take to the streets to defend their right to a cheap sweater. Or suppose the U.S. slaps a tariff on foreign sweaters and the foreign country retaliates by raising a tariff on something we're selling them--the people who would lose their jobs aren't even identifiable for sure, though for sure they exist. Likewise the people who lose jobs because shoppers who have to pay more for sweaters have less money to spend on other things. It's by considering all these things--the risk of losing your job one way minus the risk of losing it another, the extra money you make if your industry is shielded from foreign competition minus the extra money you pay for goods and services that are protected--that you reach the conclusion that on average, free trade benefits us all. Yes, there are various economic theories about circumstances in which all this may not be true, but their authors win prizes precisely because the circumstances are unusual. In general, the numbers work irrespective of what policies other countries follow. They just get worse if one country's trade restrictions lead other countries to impose more of the same. Trouble is, who's got time for all that math Still, a half-century of general prosperity in the U.S. has created a climate of toleration, if not enthusiasm, for the free-trade gospel--mostly, indeed, as a gospel of our civic religion rather than out of anyone's buying the math. Alarm about imports tends to ebb and flow with the economy--less in good times, more in bad. So how, in the best times ever, did the World Trade Organization become the global bogeyman No earnest college kid ever hitched across the country to carry a picket sign against the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO's predecessor, although its function was similar. It took decades for the CIA, the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations to achieve their places in the pantheon of political paranoia. The WTO has joined them in just four years. And it is despised across the entire political spectrum, whereas these other groups symbolize evil only to one political extreme or the other. Part of the explanation is the special nature of our current prosperity, which is widening the income gap rather than narrowing it, as in the past. Part is the growth of global economic forces that are actually impinging on national sovereignty, even though it's the paranoid hysterics who say so. But the WTO isn't responsible for either of these trends, both of which are probably inevitable and neither of which undermines the basic case for free trade or for an organization empowered to promote trade through binding arbitration of trade disputes. Maybe it's the name. If you call yourself the World Trade Organization, you can't complain much if people dial your 800 number and gripe about world trade. If a bunch of heads of government plan a triumphalist self-celebration in Seattle, you can't blame party poopers for showing up to horn in on the publicity. But really, the WTO is O.K. Do the math. Or take it on faith. MORE TIME STORIES: Cover Date: December 13, 1999 </text>

<title>CNN.com - Free trade at all costs? - Mar 4, 2005</title>
<text>Manage alerts | What is this CNN -- The Bush administration is trying to push the Central American Free Trade Agreement through Congress quickly and quietly. The White House, however, couldn't find the votes for this so-called free trade agreement before his re-election in the fall, and the president likely doesn't have the votes for it now. And that's a good thing for American workers. CAFTA advocates say the agreement would open up free trade between the United States and the Dominican Republic and five countries in Central America: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. But this agreement represents the same free trade at all costs policy that has led to a 70 percent increase in the trade deficit since 2001. We're not signing trade agreements to open new markets for our exports. Instead we're continuing to enter into outsourcing agreements with countries that cannot possibly buy our goods. If you add up the gross domestic products of the six CAFTA economies, the total market comes to about $85 billion, according to the latest available figures. That's only slightly larger than the economy of New Haven, Connecticut and less than a fifth of the size of New York City. As such, expanding trade with this bloc cannot possibly be a serious growth driver for the $11 trillion U.S. economy. The CAFTA trading partners are simply too poor and too small to serve as major consumer markets for anything made in America, if indeed we still are manufacturing anything in this country. But with 40 percent of workers in Central America earning less than $2 a day, CAFTA will pit the working poor of these countries against American workers, especially textile workers and small farmers. U.S. multinationals don't exactly have a great track record when it comes to keeping jobs at home in the face of cheaper labor overseas. More than 35 percent of all U.S. goods exports to the six CAFTA countries consist of turnaround exports, which are unfinished textile, apparel and other materials that are not ultimately consumed in these countries. These "round-trip" imports are assembled by low-wage workers and exported right back to the American marketplace. As a result, U.S. exports to CAFTA countries generally produce greater imports to our market, which further swells the worsening record trade deficit. In fact, turnaround exports have contributed to the U.S. trade deficit with the six CAFTA nations rising by nearly 60 percent from 1997-2004, according to the U.S. Business & Industry Council. And at least three of the six CAFTA countries are in such a weak financial position they couldn't possibly boost imports. The Dominican Republic is currently receiving a $665 million standby loan from the International Monetary Fund to help the country emerge from its economic crisis of 2003. The program is set to last until mid-2007, and the country will be under pressure to increase exports and curb imports. Unless, of course, those imports are turnaround imports that are shipped right back into the U.S. market. Honduras and Nicaragua are also receiving special debt relief from the IMF because of their great indebtedness and high poverty rates. While they're not austerity programs like the Dominican Republic's, neither country has much capacity to sharply increase net imports. "Americans know a bad trade deal when they see one," says Ernest Baynard, executive director of Americans for Fair Trade. "They've already had to live through one for 10 years under NAFTA." U.S. workers have lost nearly 900,000 jobs as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement, most of them in the higher-paying manufacturing sector, according to the Economic Policy Institute. But NAFTA's effects are even more evident in our exploding trade deficit. Exports to Canada and Mexico have more than doubled since 1993, but imports to our neighboring countries have risen by 173 percent, from $151 billion to $412 billion. As a result, the trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has ballooned from $9.1 billion in 1993 to $110.8 billion last year. CAFTA may bring lower prices to consumers, but it would most likely lead to more jobs being shipped to cheap foreign labor markets. And a new poll on CAFTA shows American consumers do not want to give up their jobs for lower prices, according to the nonprofit organization Americans for Fair Trade. In fact, 74 percent of those polled said they would oppose CAFTA if it reduces consumer prices but eliminates jobs for American workers. "The only people who stand to gain from CAFTA," Baynard adds, "are people who are offshoring jobs already or want to offshore jobs." That is something we simply cannot afford. Working Americans know all too well the high cost of free trade. I can only hope Congress has learned that lesson as well. Story Tools</text>

<title>Bush challenges Congress on free trade pact - CNN.com</title>
<text>Bush challenges Congress on free trade pact Story Highlights NEW: Top Democrats says action jeopardizes pact's chances of passing Sen. McCain backs deal; Sens. Clinton and Obama oppose pact Bush says trade pact with Colombia would advance U.S. "security interests" Move forces vote on pact within 90 working days WASHINGTON CNN -- President Bush on Monday moved to force a vote on a controversial free trade agreement between the United States and Colombia that Democrats oppose. President Bush calls on Congress to vote on the Colombia free trade deal within 90 days. During an appearance at the White House, Bush said he signed a letter giving Congress 90 working days to vote on the agreement, which would allow goods to move between the United States and Colombia without being taxed. Bush said the agreement would "advance America's national security interests in a critical region" and "strengthen a courageous ally in our hemisphere," as well as help the U.S. economy. The administration signed the agreement almost a year and a half ago and had been working with congressional leaders to schedule a vote on the pact. Bush said he decided to force Congress to take up the measure because the "need for this agreement is too urgent; the stakes for our national security are too high to allow this year to end without a vote." Watch Bush call Colombia a 'brave ally' » House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and and Charlie Rangel, D-New York, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, called Bush's move "counterproductive" and said it jeopardized the chances that the bill would pass. "A successful trade agenda depends on a joint partnership between the Congress and the administration, where consultation is the norm, not the exception," the two said in a joint statement. "The president's disregard toward a co-equal branch of government serves only to work against the long-term interests of the United States and Colombia ." Don't Miss Bush urges Congress to pass key legislation Last week, Pelosi, a California Democrat, indicated she would oppose the bill unless it is accompanied by protections for U.S. workers. She did not "recommend" Bush send the bill to Congress, she said. And the Senate majority leader, Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, warned Bush was setting up the agreement to fail. "Many Democrats continue to have serious concerns about an agreement that creates the highest level of economic integration with a country where workers and their families are routinely murdered and subjected to violence and intimidation for seeking to exercise their most basic economic rights. And the perpetrators of the violence have near total impunity," he said in a statement shortly after Bush spoke. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice praised the agreement in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal on Monday. She said the free trade bill "could strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. workers; support a democratic ally on the cusp of achieving lasting national success; weaken those who would sow instability and autocracy in our hemisphere; and send an unequivocal signal to the entire world that the United States is a confident, capable global leader that acts not only in its own interest, but in the interest of its friends." Both leading Democratic presidential candidates oppose the bill. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois said Friday that Bush was "absolutely wrong" to support the deal, adding that the Colombian government was suspected of "potentially having supported violence against unions, against labor, against opposition." Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York said last week: "We've got to have new trade policies before we have new trade deals. That includes no trade deal with Colombia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country." Her chief strategist, Mark Penn, was forced to resign over the weekend amid revelations that he had met Colombia's ambassador to the U.S. to discuss the free trade deal. Penn is also CEO of Burson-Marsteller, a public-relations giant that was working for the government of Colombia. Colombia fired the firm after Penn said his meeting with the ambassador had been a mistake. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, is on record supporting free trade agreements with South American countries, including Colombia. "We need to build on the passage of the Central America Free Trade Agreement by expanding U.S. trade with the region. Let's start by ratifying the trade agreements with Panama, Peru and Colombia that are already completed, and pushing forward the Free Trade Area of the Americas," he said last June. A senior Democratic leadership aide in the Senate said that if the measure passes the House, where it will be considered first, its future in the Senate is "unpredictable." In particular, the aide points to concerns in the Democratic caucus about the murders of hundreds of trade unionists in Colombia. A top Republican leadership aide in the Senate said there is "sufficient support" in the Senate but worries politics -- presidential and otherwise - could be problematic. "The question is: What games will be played between here and there" the aide said. E-mail to a friend CNN's Kathleen Koch, Deirdre Walsh and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.</text>

<title>Dobbs: We're on a 'fast track' to bad trade policy - CNN.com</title>
<text>Adjust font size: Editor's note: Lou Dobbs' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com NEW YORK CNN -- The powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Charlie Rangel, and I sat down together last night to talk about, among other things, his new book, "And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since." For 36 years, Rangel has served the constituents of Harlem -- what the new Ways and Means chairman calls "the capital of black America." The chairman's new book is a terrific read and tells the fascinating story of his rise from the impoverished streets of New York to the corridors of power on Capitol Hill. You'll love the book and the story of Rangel's life. And I suspect you'll have the same thought I did when you finally set the book down: How many more Charlie Rangels will be denied their shot at the American dream because Capitol Hill's corridors are now filled with corporate America's lobbyists, who are working to assure that our middle class and those who aspire to it have as little representation as possible Watch Lou's interview with Rep. Rangel Chairman Rangel and other House and Senate leaders face an early test of the Democratic Party's commitment to restoring the vigor of the world's most successful political economy. The test will come in the form of the mind-numbingly dull piece of legislation called Trade Promotion Authority, or "fast track." But there is nothing dull about the impact of the legislation, through which Congress cedes its constitutional authority on trade policymaking to the White House as cited in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Thirty-one years of consecutive trade deficits and the loss -- in just the last six years -- of millions of manufacturing and good-paying middle-class jobs to outsourcing have been the result of what I consider this unconstitutional ceding of power to the executive branch in the form of fast-track authority. Last week, I testified to the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade that our failed "free trade" of the past three decades has been the most expensive policy the U.S. government has ever pursued. I also told the committee: "The pursuit of so-called free trade has resulted in the opening of the world's richest consumer market to foreign competitors without negotiating a reciprocal opening of world markets for U.S. goods and services. That isn't free trade by any definition, whether that of classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo or that of current propaganda ministers who use the almost Orwellian term to promote continuation of the trade policies followed for the last three decades." Extending fast-track authority assures that continuation. I'm not alone in the view that free-trade-at-all-costs has harmed American workers. Princeton University economist and former Federal Reserve Board vice chairman Alan S. Blinder has joined Nobel laureates Paul Samuelson and Joseph Stiglitz and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers as skeptics of the benefits the faith-based economists in this administration love to tout. Blinder is now stating loudly that a new industrial revolution will put as many as 40 million American jobs at risk of being shipped out of the country in the next decade or two. Blinder has said, "Economists who insist that 'offshore outsourcing' is just a routine extension of international trade are overlooking how major a transformation it will likely bring -- and how significant the consequences could be. The governments and societies of the developed world must start preparing, and fast." I hope that Chairman Rangel and the Democratic leaders of both the House and Senate will refuse to renew fast-track authority and demand their constitutional power over trade policymaking and begin representing working men and women in all future trade negotiations. I'm sure Charlie Rangel would agree with me that every American deserves the right to better days, a promise that is the foundation of our country and the American dream.

<title>AllPolitics - Analysis: What's Next In Fast-Track Debate - Nov. 12, 1997</title>
<text>Analysis: What's Next In Fast-Track Debate After a presidential defeat, fast-track supporters search for alternatives By Craig Staats/AllPolitics WASHINGTON Nov. 12 -- When President Bill Clinton met with reporters earlier this week for a post-mortem on his stalled bid for fast-track trade negotiating authority, the president was at his "What-me-worry" best. Just a temporary setback, Clinton suggested. They would bring the legislation back at an "appropriate" time, he said, when they could fold in Democratic concerns about labor and environmental standards overseas and carry the day. "And what we need to do is to sort of unpack the politics and the emotion and the substance and try to go back and put this together in a way that allows us to have a big bipartisan majority in the House for a constructive fast-track authority that enables us to move forward on all these fronts," Clinton said. "And I think we'll be able to do it." Forget the presidential bravura, though. The fact is that in the wake of Clinton's defeat, supporters of free trade are already looking to fill the vacuum with some "small-is-beautiful" alternatives to what the president wanted. Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth has said if Clinton fails again, he will push for a stripped-down alternative that would focus on industries in which the U.S. has a competitive edge, including information technology. "I intend to develop a narrower fast-track proposal that would allow us to move forward," the Delaware Republican told The Associated Press. Even Democratic House leader Dick Gephardt, an opponent of the stalled fast-track proposal and a likely rival to Vice President Al Gore in 2000, is talking about offering an alternative . If Gephardt comes up with something that organized labor can support, that could help him and further cut into Gore's standing as the Democrats' heir apparent. What happened on fast-track over the weekend was a clear win for the nation's labor movement, which ran TV ads and inundated members of Congress with phone calls and letters in opposition. The postponement of the fast-track vote represented a disappointing defeat for Clinton, who found himself out of step with both House Democrats and labor. It puts at risk an important goal for Clinton's second term: to lay the groundwork for creating free-trade areas in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific. Clinton believes, as do many economists and business leaders, that free trade spurs economic growth. The setback also will put Clinton in an uncomfortable position when he heads to Vancouver, B.C., next month for a meeting of the 18-nation Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Leaders there surely will want to hear what Clinton says about the chances for renewed fast-track authority. Along with Gephardt, one person who comes out of this in better shape is House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who worked with Clinton and avoided trying to score political points when it was clear Clinton didn't have the Democratic votes he needed. Even some of Gingrich's Republican critics in the House have praised how he handled the issue. For the Clinton Administration, doing without fast-track authority will mean a tougher time in trade negotiations. Nations are reluctant to negotiate deals with the U.S. if they fear endless changes in the Congress. But the administration still has authority to complete talks it began under the so-called Uruguay Round of global trade talks. In Other News:</text>

<title>CNN.com - Miami demonstrators arrested protesting arrests - Nov. 21, 2003</title>
<text>CNN.com Miami demonstrators arrested protesting arrests Police officers detain protesters who refused to disperse from in front of the Miami-Dade County Jail. Story Tools Free Trade Area of the Americas Miami Florida Manage alerts | What is this MIAMI, Florida Reuters -- Demonstrators who gathered outside a Miami jail to protest the arrest of their colleagues during this week's trade talks were themselves arrested after defying police orders to disperse Friday. Anti-globalization activists and other protesters flocked to Miami to show opposition to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which would create the world's largest trading bloc, a free-trade area of 34 countries and 800 million people. By the time the talks ended Thursday night, more than 140 demonstrators had been arrested on charges ranging from disorderly conduct to assaulting police officers. About 100 protesters gathered near a downtown jail Friday, chanting "Let them go, let them go" and accused police of heavy-handedness. They were quickly outnumbered and surrounded by police in riot gear, who warned them to leave or face arrest for unlawful assembly. About 25 lingered, some staging a sit-in and police put them in plastic handcuffs and took them away in buses. "They were given a lawful order to disperse. They were given time to disperse," said Police Sgt. Dennis Morales. Protester Medea Benjamin, a member of the human rights group Global Exchange, said she had visited Iraq three times this year and compared the Miami police action to that of U.S. soldiers in Baghdad. "No more militarization and no more occupation in our own country," Benjamin said. Miami threw a security blanket around the trade talks, calling in thousands of law enforcement officers from around the state to squelch the kind of violence that has marred international trade talks in other cities in recent years. Miami Police Chief John Timoney, defended the officers' approach, saying they had acted effectively against a small group of protesters bent on violence. He said while most of the demonstrators were peaceful, a group he described as hard-core anarchists had thrown rocks, paint, gas canisters, smoke bombs, and fruit at police. "We are very proud of the police officers and their restraint. Lots of objects were thrown at the police officers," Timoney said. "If we didn't act when we did, it would have been much worse." He estimated the cost of providing security during the talks at $10 million to $11 million. Copyright 2003 Reuters . All rights reserved.

<title>Commentary: Is this the start of another Great Depression? - CNN.com</title>
<text>In Depth: Commentaries Unfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system . One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom. There was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn't agree on what was needed. The result was further instability. That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves. What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises. When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States. This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system. G7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week. The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum. My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can't afford to wait for years this time around. A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge. The outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed. The economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2½ months. The implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.</text>

<title>Ask the card-carrying socialists: Is Obama one of them? - CNN.com</title>
<text>Barack Obama Socialists scoff at the notion. They don't applaud the passage of the recent health care bill either. They wanted a national "single-payer" health insurance plan with a government option. The bill that Obama championed didn't have any of those features. Wharton said the new health care bill only strengthens private health insurance companies. They get 32 million new customers and no incentive to change -- something a socialist wouldn't accept. "Most of it was authored by the health care industry," Wharton says. "I call it the corporate restructuring of health care." Other critics point to Obama's Wall Street bailout -- which actually had its roots in the Bush administration. Critics say it's socialistic for government to assume control of private industry. Frank Llewellyn, national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says the bailout had nothing to do with socialism. Llewellyn says a socialist leader would have at least nationalized some of the troubled banks. "He gave them [the banks] too much with no strings attached," Llewellyn says. "Banks that were too big to fail are bigger, and they can still fail." How about Obama's bailout of the Detroit auto industry During the bailout, the federal government assumed partial ownership of General Motors. "It's not socialism," Llewellyn says. "The mere fact that the government owns something or has a stake in it, doesn't make it socialist. If that was true, you would say that we have a socialist army. The government owns the army." Defining socialism is complex, Llewellyn says, but it starts with a simple goal: Socialists want to introduce democratic features into the economy to reduce inequality. The economy has "to be run for the overall benefit of the entire population, not for the benefits of a very few people." By that measure, Obama's economic policies are not socialist, he says. "He's trying to save capitalism from itself rather than a radical trying to change into a new system," Llewellyn says. This kind of name-calling is not new. Civil rights demonstrators and the politicians who passed Medicare were also called socialists and communists, Llewellyn says. "Every time an expansion of the public's right has been put forward, Republicans have called it extreme, communistic and socialistic. It's a repeated tactic because they can't defeat the idea." A Tea Party member explains why Obama is a socialist Those arguments don't sway Conrad Quagliaroli, a Tea Party member who says Obama is a socialist. He says that Obama's voting record as a senator was more to the left than the U.S. Senate's sole socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He says Obama's association with radicals and his pledge to "spread the wealth" seal his socialistic credentials. "The role of government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other," says Quagliaroli, a financial planner who lives in Woodstock, Georgia. Quagliaroli was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that Obama is a socialist. "He's just not socialist enough for them." Quagliaroli says he doesn't like socialism because it breeds mediocrity and encourages people to "live on the dole." Capitalism "breeds excellence" because it encourages initiative, he says. The role of the government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other. --Conrad Quagliaroli, Tea Party member Does that mean that Quagliaroli will refuse his Social Security checks, a government program that has been described as socialistic, and which he opposes Not necessarily, says Quagliaroli. He says he'll accept his Social Security checks for two reasons. "They confiscated it from me to begin with, and the more money they give me, the less they'll have to waste," he says. "I can spend it better than they can. I don't pay $500 for a hammer." The argument over Obama's ideology may rage on, but at least one socialist says another prominent politician ought to be inserted into the debate. Llewellyn, the national director of the Democratic Socialists of America, says he was struck by one player in the 2008 presidential elections who displayed more socialistic leanings than Obama. This candidate raised taxes on the big oil companies, and sent the revenue to the people. If you want to learn something about spreading the wealth, Llewellyn says, don't look to Obama. "To be honest, the most socialist candidate in the 2008 election was Sarah Palin." Share this on:</text>

<sentence cont=1 >The government owns the army." Defining socialism is complex, Llewellyn says, but it starts with a simple goal: Socialists want to introduce democratic features into the economy to reduce inequality.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The economy has "to be run for the overall benefit of the entire population, not for the benefits of a very few people." By that measure, Obama's economic policies are not socialist, he says.</sentence>

<sentence cont=1 >This kind of name-calling is not new.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Civil rights demonstrators and the politicians who passed Medicare were also called socialists and communists, Llewellyn says.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Every time an expansion of the public's right has been put forward, Republicans have called it extreme, communistic and socialistic.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >It's a repeated tactic because they can't defeat the idea." A Tea Party member explains why Obama is a socialist Those arguments don't sway Conrad Quagliaroli, a Tea Party member who says Obama is a socialist.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >He says that Obama's voting record as a senator was more to the left than the U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Senate's sole socialist, Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >He says Obama's association with radicals and his pledge to "spread the wealth" seal his socialistic credentials.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"The role of government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other," says Quagliaroli, a financial planner who lives in Woodstock, Georgia.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Quagliaroli was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that Obama is a socialist.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"He's just not socialist enough for them." Quagliaroli says he doesn't like socialism because it breeds mediocrity and encourages people to "live on the dole." Capitalism "breeds excellence" because it encourages initiative, he says.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The role of the government is to provide a safe environment to conduct business, not to take from one and give to the other. --Conrad Quagliaroli, Tea Party member Does that mean that Quagliaroli will refuse his Social Security checks, a government program that has been described as socialistic, and which he opposes Not necessarily, says Quagliaroli.</sentence>

<title>Commentary: How Obama can fix the economy - CNN.com</title>
<text>In Depth: Commentaries Candidate Obama spoke of $150 billion of fiscal stimulus. But if this recession turns out to be the deepest since World War II, as now seems certain, the appropriate figure will be at least four times that large. Anything less would fail to cushion the downturn. A trillion-dollar deficit will excite fears of government out of control if not accompanied by a plan to balance the budget once the recession ends. The new president therefore will need to offer not just a stimulus package but also a multiyear budget. Then there is the problem of the auto industry. The best course normally would be Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This would allow the Big Three to shed bad management and contracts, both of which would be thrown out in the bankruptcy process. If GM, Ford or Chrysler is then able to come up with a viable business plan, they should be able to obtain the new money, known as debtor-in-possession financing, needed to implement it. Admittedly, the credit crisis makes new money difficult to obtain. But if this is a problem, then the government can provide the debtor-in-possession financing. In other words, it can make its aid conditional on the Big Three first going through bankruptcy workouts. A further complication arises from the fact that cars last for years and when they break down are expensive to repair. Warranties matter, in other words. If a producer was undergoing bankruptcy reorganization, from which it might or might not emerge, consumers would question whether its warranties were worth the paper they were written on. But if this is the problem, then the government can guarantee the warranties. It could reimburse the cost of major repairs subject to terms and conditions. It is not as if our government has been reluctant to guarantee other products, ranging from bank deposits to money market mutual funds. And this guarantee should be provided only to auto companies that undergo bankruptcy reorganization. Finally, it will be important for the new president to reassure our foreign partners about his economic intentions. There may be jubilation in Kenya and Indonesia over the election of a candidate they may view as a native son, but there is trepidation in Asia and Latin America about his protectionist rhetoric. President Obama will need to reassure Mexico that while he believes in labor and environmental standards, he also believes in NAFTA. He should encourage the Congress to ratify our free trade agreements with Colombia and Korea. He should reassure the Chinese, who now have economic problems of their own, that he will not bash them over their exchange rate policies. If Obama wishes to help Americans impacted by import competition there are better ways. He can expand trade adjustment assistance for displaced workers. He can propose wage insurance -- partial compensation for a limited period for workers moving to lower-paid jobs. He can ramp up spending on education and training. He can address concerns over the environment by proposing a carbon tax rather than allowing blame for global warming to be shifted to Mexico and China. That should be enough to keep the new president occupied for his first 100 days. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barry Eichengreen.</text>

<title>Rep. Ron Paul's early book included controversial passages - CNN.com</title>
<text>Rep. Ron Paul's early book included controversial passages By Peter Hamby, CNN Political Reporter Des Moines, Iowa CNN -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul has distanced himself from a series of controversial newsletters from the 1980s and 1990s that bore his name and included inflammatory and racially charged language. As the newsletters burst into view, first during his 2008 presidential bid and again in recent weeks after he climbed to the front of the Republican race in Iowa, Paul has blamed the writings on ghostwriters. He said he was not aware of the "bad stuff," as he described it. But one of Paul's own books, published solely under his name, contains several passages that could be problematic as he attempts to push his libertarian message into the political mainstream. In his 1987 manifesto "Freedom Under Siege: The U.S. Constitution after 200-Plus Years," Paul wrote that AIDS patients were victims of their own lifestyle, questioned the rights of minorities and argued that people who are sexually harassed at work should quit their jobs. The slim, 157-page volume was published ahead of Paul's 1988 Libertarian Party presidential bid and touches on many of the themes he continues to hammer on the stump. Returning again and again to the of concept of "liberty," he hails the virtues of the gold standard, attacks the Federal Reserve and defends the rights of gun-owners. But the book, re-issued in 2007 during Paul's last presidential bid with a cover photograph of an ominous SWAT Team, has so far escaped scrutiny amid the latest furor over his newsletters. In one section of the book, Paul criticized people suffering from AIDS or other contagious diseases for demanding health insurance coverage. "The individual suffering from AIDS certainly is a victim -- frequently a victim of his own lifestyle -- but this same individual victimizes innocent citizens by forcing them to pay for his care," Paul wrote. In another chapter on the rights of individuals outside of government - the central theme of Paul's libertarian philosophy -- he sharply criticized the "absurdity" of politicians who try to bestow differing rights on various social and ethnic groups. It's dangerous to craft a separate set of rights for groups like Hispanics, African-Americans, children, employees and the homeless, Paul wrote. "Until all these terms are dropped and we recognize that only an individual has rights the solution to the mess in which we find ourselves will not be found," Paul explained. "Every year new groups organize to demand their 'rights,'" he continued. "White people who organize and expect the same attention as other groups are quickly and viciously condemned as dangerous bigots. Hispanic, black, and Jewish caucuses can exist in the U.S. Congress, but not a white caucus, demonstrating the absurdity of this approach for achieving rights for everyone." Paul also defended the rights of an individual to "control property and run his or her business as he or she chooses," without interference from "the social do-gooder." In a passage first flagged by the Houston Chronicle in 2007, Paul then claimed that sexual harassment should not be a violation of one's employment rights. "Employee rights are said to be valid when employers pressure employees into sexual activity," Paul wrote. "Why don't they quit once the so-called harassment starts Obviously the morals of the harasser cannot be defended, but how can the harassee escape some responsibility for the problem Seeking protection under civil rights legislation is hardly acceptable." Paul's campaign manager Jesse Benton defended the book and said the candidate "has been speaking out for decades that rights do not come from belonging to a group." "Rights come because we are all individuals, endowed by our creator, and Americans must look beyond race or creed and recognize that we all deserving of the same Liberty," Benton told CNN in an email. "This truth is a tenant of natural law and the only way we will achieve a color blind and truly free society." Share this on:</text>

<title>Climate change report: 'extremely likely' that humans are responsible - CNN.com</title>
<text>Scottish salmon fisheries imperiled U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry echoed his words in an official statement. "Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire," he said. "Once again, the science grows clearer, the case grows more compelling, and the costs of inaction grow beyond anything that anyone with conscience or common sense should be willing to even contemplate." Beneath Greenland's ice, a grand canyon The assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is the benchmark study on global warming published every few years. Nearly 1,000 researchers from around the world work on the document, which then undergoes review by about as many scientists. The panel released a summary report Friday and plans to post the full version, roughly 2,500 pages, online on Monday. This year's report further strengthens the suspicions that scientists already have. In 2007, climate researchers were already 90% sure that people were behind a seemingly small rise in global average temperature of about half a degree Celsius 1 degree Fahrenheit that has already notched up extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and flooding. While 90% constitutes a "very likely" degree of certainty, Friday's report stating scientists are now 95% sure indicates an "extremely likely" degree of certainty, which is considered the gold standard when discussing probability. The effects humans are already causing are expected to increase for a century or more, the report reads. Weather catastrophes, previously called storms of the century, are on their way to striking every 20 years or even more frequently. Bloomberg: Why Sandy forced cities to take lead on climate change This means, unfortunately, that we could see more EF5 tornadoes like the one that ground up Moore, Oklahoma; stronger and more floods like those that inundated Colorado towns; another Sandy or Katrina or two in our lifetimes; more crops wiped out by drought; and more forestland consumed by roaring wildfires. The Arctic ice cap could melt nearly completely in summer, and sea levels could continue to rise. In the Antarctic, the ice cap could continue to increase slightly. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb as they have, the resulting temperature rise and its deadly effects would get even worse, the report says. Hundreds of experts weigh in The 2013 assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change brings together the latest research from top scientists in the field. It contains a "summary for policymakers" aimed at guiding politicians and lawmakers worldwide on decisions regarding the environment over the next several years. The document released Friday explains the physical science behind climate change. The U.N. panel releases a report every five or six years. Friday's report is the culmination of work by more than 250 authors from 39 countries and was subject to an extensive review process involving more than 1,000 experts. More than 850 expert authors from 85 countries contributed research for the full report, which will be released in three stages through April. The first, on the physical science behind climate change, accompanies the summary for policymakers. The second, expected in March, will cover "impacts and vulnerabilities" of climate change; the third, on mitigation efforts, is set to go out in April. Climate change may increase violence, study shows Critics of the report Despite the breadth of the scientific expertise involved and the extensive review and approval process, the assessment reports spark quite a few criticisms, from both climate change believers and skeptics. Skeptics say the panel exists only to produce further evidence supporting the idea of man-made climate change while ignoring opposing research. But climate change activists, and many climate scientists, say the panel's consensus-seeking policy produces conclusions and estimates that are too conservative. Another often-cited critique of the report is that, due to its size and lengthy approval process, it is already outdated by the time it is released. Several important studies already have been published in the past year in the constantly evolving science of climate change that will not be included in this assessment. Despite the critics, this week's document will serve as a major measuring stick for the current state of the world's climate and what type of change is in store. The summary for policymakers will be available Friday at www.climatechange2013.org .</text>

<title>Internet mourns Steve Jobs' resignation  - CNN.com</title>
<text>Internet mourns Steve Jobs' resignation By John D. Sutter, CNN People turn to social media to discuss Steve Jobs' resignation Many take a somber tone, mourning the end of his career CNN -- It's a moment many tech fans hoped never would come: Steve Jobs' resignation from the helm of Apple, which he co-founded from his family garage in 1976. As that news hit early Wednesday evening on the East Coast , people rushed to online social networks to mourn the apparent end of Jobs' career; talk about what this means for the future of Apple products like the iPhone; and wish him good health. "The end of an era!" one Twitter user wrote. "I pray it's not bc because of his health," said another. "he was one of the most innovative and incredible men ever. I will not be the only one to shed a few tears over this news," wrote another. Jobs will remain with the company as chairman of Apple's board of directors. But some commenters acted like he had passed away. "I'll miss him. I'll miss his vision. I'll miss his character. I'll miss every terajoule of his near unlimited energy," wrote one of @cnntech's Twitter followers. Steve Jobs' legacy with Apple Will Apple be OK without Jobs Tim Cook new Apple CEO RELATED TOPICS Apple has not released any new information about the state of Jobs' health. The 56-year-old went on medical leave in January, and he has suffered serious health problems in recent years, including pancreatic cancer and a reported liver transplant. Jobs also took a somber tone in his resignation letter: "I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I would be the first to let you know," he wrote in a letter to Apple's board and the Apple community at large. "Unfortunately, that day has come." In the immediate moments after the announcement, tech pundits seemed far more concerned with the state of Jobs' health than the future of the company that relies on him as its creative core. Apple is credited with kicking off the personal computing revolution. It also ushered in the smartphone craze after it released the iPhone in 2007 and rocked the digital music industry with iTunes. The tech blog Gizmodo wrote a short tribute to Jobs: "We very, very much hope that the greatest businessman, CEO and product developer of our era is doing okay, and that this decision does not mean his health has taken a turn for the worse. He is an icon and idol who has made this world we live in a better place. We sincerely and deeply wish Mr. Jobs and his family the best." More from a commenter on the blog Boy Genius Report : "Best of luck to Steve!! I have nothing but love and respect for him and the way that he handled things at Apple! He created the best tech company in the world! I wish him luck on whatever he does from here on out! And good luck to Tim Cook! He's gotta fill some size 100000000 shoes!!!" Even people who aren't generally Apple fans praised Jobs: "While I may not like some of Apple's practices and tactics, there is no denying that Steve Jobs took that company at its lowest point and made it into the gold standard of consumer technology," wrote Eric Geller, in a discussion CNN Tech started on the Google Plus social network. "Not since Bill Gates has any tech executive been this iconic and well-known among mainstream consumers." Others jokingly compared the news to other signs of the apocalypse, including the rare earthquake that hit the East Coast earlier this week. "Earthquake, Hurricane, Middle East on the brink of war, now Steve Jobs resigns The apocalypse is very, very near, folks," a Twitter user wrote. And still others passed around bits of Apple nostalgia. The blog Boing Boing shared an early Apple commercial from 1984 . Tim Carmody, a blogger at Wired, posted on Google Plus a 2001 video of Jobs introducing the first Apple store. Feel free to share your thoughts about this news in the comments section below.

<title>Paul's long-held policies converge with Tea Party's - CNN.com</title>
<text>U.S. Politics "Mainstream is now thinking about these things. Before, mainstream was deficits don't matter, print money when you need it, endless wars, personal privacy that didn't mean anything," Paul said on CNN's "State of the Union" recently. "But believe me, mainstream is moving in the direction that I have been talking about for a long time, and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election." Although he raises significant campaign funds, fundraising success doesn't necessarily translate to electoral wins. While running for the 2008 GOP nomination, Paul raised $20 million in the last quarter of 2007, mostly through individual contributions, which was twice as much raised by eventual Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But he barely breached 10% in the early presidential voting states. After he dropped out of the race in June 2008, he used his remaining funds to form Campaign for Liberty, designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances. An early champion of virtual campaigning, Paul coined the term "money bomb" for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website. He raised more than $1 million during his most recent "money bomb" in June but fell short of the $2 million goal. The Pittsburgh native first ran for the White House in 1988 as the Libertarian Party candidate against Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote, or 432,000 votes, in the general election. But don't expect him to seek a third-party bid in 2012. "We don't have a democracy in this country. It's so biased," Paul told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. "If you're a third party, you can't -- I can't get into debates as a third-party candidate. When I did it as a third party, I spent over half my money just to get on the ballot." As a GOP candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances, popular with Republican voters in many of the early nominating states. He has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, something he said is an increase in federal power. Paul also told Wolf Blitzer in May that he supports the "protection of all human life." "I'm for repealing Roe v. Wade. And it's not an attack on women's rights," Paul said on CNN's "The Situation Room." "Women have rights, but they also have a responsibility if they're responsible for life." Paul has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies. After graduating from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, he served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force before moving to Texas with his wife Carol and eventually representing the 14th District that includes the cities of Victoria and Galveston. He will be 77 in 2012, but Paul, a father of five and grandfather of 18, said he doesn't feel old. "Where do I get my energy and where do I get my support and the enthusiasm It comes from the young people," Paul told Blitzer. "That really excites me because this issue is so important. It's important to my kids. It's an important point to all the kids of America." Share this on:</text>

<title>Ron Paul's money plan is far from golden - CNN.com</title>
<text>Ron Paul's money plan is far from golden By David Frum, CNN Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ron Paul won the presidential straw poll at the CPAC conference David Frum says part of Paul's appeal is his advocacy of basing dollars on precious metals He says the gold standard made the downturn of the 1930s into the Great Depression The markets won't take seriously any revival of the gold standard, he says Editor's note: David Frum writes a weekly column for CNN.com. A resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, he was special assistant to President George W. Bush in 2001-2. He is the author of six books, including "Comeback: Conservatism That Can Win Again" and the editor of FrumForum . Washington CNN -- The annual Conservative Political Action Conference drew 10,000 activists to Washington over the weekend. The event traditionally concludes with a presidential straw poll. Last year, the poll was won by Mitt Romney. This year, Ron Paul won, with 31 percent of the ballots cast. CPAC's organizers cautioned against over-interpreting the Paul win. Participation in the poll had been light, the Paul team had just out-organized, etc. All true enough. But it's also true that Ron Paul-style themes have percolated through the conservative movement since Paul's beat-the-spread 2008 presidential campaign. Of all those themes, the one that has achieved the widest audience is Paul 's call for a return to money based on precious metals such as gold and silver. G.K. Chesterton observed that you should never pull down a fence until you understand why it was put up. So let's rediscover why it was that Americans abandoned the gold standard in the first place. In 1929, the U.S. economy slumped into recession. Under the weight of a series of terrible decisions, that recession collapsed into the worldwide Great Depression. But why did decision-makers make so many bad decisions The short answer is that they were trapped. Almost all of the right decisions would have ballooned the U.S. federal budget deficit. As budget deficits expanded, investors would inevitably worry that their dollars might lose value in the future. They would demand to trade their dollars for gold at the fixed price of $20.67 to the ounce. Under the rules of the gold standard, the U.S. government would be obliged to sell. Video: Paul is CPAC pick RELATED TOPICS U.S. Federal Reserve As long as the deficits continued, the U.S. government would lose gold. Threatened with the exhaustion of its gold supply, the government felt it had no choice: It had to close the budget deficit. So, in the throes of a severe downturn, the U.S. government did exactly the opposite of what economists would otherwise advise: It cut spending and raised taxes -- capsizing the economy even deeper into depression. It's very strange to hear gold standard advocates criticize President Hoover for imposing steep tax increases in 1932, the Depression's worst year. Yet the gold standard they champion was the reason for the tax increases they deplore. Between 1929 and 1932, the U.S. money supply collapsed, as banks failed and bank deposits and commercial credit vanished. In their classic "Monetary History of the United States" 1966, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz identified this contraction of the money supply as the proximate cause of the Great Depression. Why didn't the Federal Reserve act to prevent the contraction Again: the gold standard. In a modern recession, the Fed will buy Treasury securities in the open market. After the purchase and sale, the Federal Reserve has more securities -- and the former owners of the securities have new cash. Those new cash owners then spend or lend their cash, spurring economic activity. But in 1930, the new cash owners didn't spend or lend. They swapped their cash for gold. The "open market" operations that were supposed to accelerate economic activity instead accelerated the country's gold drain. So the Fed ceased -- and instead passively allowed the economy to collapse in order to save the nation's currency. Every other gold-standard country faced similar challenges in the 1930s. Those countries that quit gold first, like Britain, suffered least. Those that hung onto gold longest -- the United States and France -- suffered most. Imagine now if the gold standard were in operation today. The federal government would be scrambling to balance its budget in the midst of recession, cutting spending and raising taxes. Instead of pumping money into the economy, the Federal Reserve would be sucking money out. Priority 1 would not be creating and saving jobs, but preserving the nation's gold hoard. Instead of living through the nastiest recession since the war, we'd be deep into a second Great Depression. But in a way, this counterfactual is impossible. No government ever can return to the gold standard. Back in the 1930s, governments accepted horrific suffering because they were terrified of the consequences of going off gold. When President Franklin Roosevelt told his budget director, Lewis Douglas, of his decision to quit gold, Douglas replied: "This is the end of Western civilization." He wasn't kidding either. In fact, the decision was the turning point of the Depression, the beginning of recovery. And every monetary economist knows it. Which means that the first thing any future gold-standard government would do in the event of recession would be to jettison gold. And every market trader knows that too. So ... as soon as the first sign of recession materializes on the horizon, the traders would dump the currency of the gold standard country. The gold standard country would then have to decide whether to self-impose draconian 1932-style budget-balancing or forgo the whole painful experience and surrender right away to what is inevitable sooner or later. Since everybody knows that a gold standard country would quit gold as soon as times got tough, nobody will ever believe the decision to restore the gold standard in the first place. It's as dead as monocles and walking sticks. Deader, really. The punch line to one of my favorite anecdotes goes, "Son, your answers are so old, I have forgotten the questions." Has the Depression receded so far into history that the answers that once plunged the nation into misery can possibly look credible again The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of David Frum.

<title>My View: Why I chose home schooling - CNN.com</title>
<text>My View: Why I chose home schooling By Bethany Gardiner - Special to CNN updated 10:35 AM EDT, Tue April 10, 2012 CNN -- Editor's Note: Bethany M. Gardiner, M.D., is a pediatrician and author of "Highlighting Homeschooling," which guides parents through the educational options available to them and their children. As a pediatrician, I was a dedicated career woman and never thought much about the schooling options of either my children or my patients. I was a product of public schools and assumed the traditional schooling model was fine. However, as I listened to my patients and their parents, I realized there was a theme being repeated many times over in family after family. They were stressed about their fast-paced lives and the futility of being forced into a box of expectations for a life that they did not fit into. Whether it was fighting against a system that penalized sick children for too many missed days, trying to challenge children that are bored in class, arguments about an ADHD diagnosis, to the hours of homework and busywork that intruded upon family time, parents were feeling overwhelmed and out of control, and these feelings were being transmitted to their children. The more I considered these facts, I realized that I myself was losing a family-centric lifestyle, struggling against the demands of an outside system while trying to balance a career and my family. I knew that to impact my family and children in the most positive way possible, I needed to take control of my children's education and tailor it to meet their needs and those of my family. By participating in their education, I could teach a love of learning and a passion for education that I saw missing in most of my patients that went to traditional brick and mortar schools. And while meeting the needs of my children, I could also improve my family life by adding to the time that we spent together rather than taking away from it. If you are like I was in the beginning, you might be attracted to the idea of home schooling for the benefits, but still worried about whether it is for you. You might be worried that you are not a trained teacher, or patient and creative. Rest assured, I quickly learned that I was not very patient or creative either, but all I needed was the already present love for my children and the desire to see them reach their fullest potential. You might be worried that it would take too much time and that you could not continue working on your other pursuits. Well, it does take some time, but when you think that you don't have to wash uniforms, drive back and forth to school, or participate in school fundraisers, it isn't all that much more time and add in that you will be able to meet the needs of your children better than any institution ever can. I was also able to continue working with minor adjustments to my schedule. Home schooling becomes a lifestyle that will draw your family together, while traditional schools are a separating force, from the physical separation during the school day to the hours of homework at night. With home schooling, you can tailor the work time to fit in with the family instead of making the family conform around the needs of others. There is still work to be done and lessons to be learned, but they can be fit in whenever it is best for you and your children. Learning can be extended effortlessly into all aspects of life from errands to vacations. Also, extending learning outside of traditional classroom resources leads to practical applications and real world experiences that are hard to achieve in brick and mortar schools. Aside from the family and lifestyle improvements that home schooling fosters, the removal of the one-size-fits-all classroom mentality leads to a highly tailored educational experience for your child. There is time for side trips according to their interests. These side trips help spark intellectual curiosity as well as promote the development of critical thinking and self-directed learning. Colleges complain that many children come to them ill-prepared for collegiate level studies and have begun to actively recruit home-schoolers, realizing that home schooled children have the skills necessary for independent learning because they are built into the home schooling lifestyle and educational model by its very nature. After over a decade home schooling, with one child now in college and another in high school, I can truly say it has been the best experience of my life and the best choice for my children and family. As a home-schooling parent, I became a cheerleader, facilitator, mentor, and role-model. I also have the knowledge that we are a tighter knit family unit because of the experiences we shared and I wouldn't trade that for anything. Home schooling might not be a journey for everyone, but I feel fortunate to have taken the trip. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bethany Gardiner.</text>

<title>CNN.com - No school, no books, no teacher's dirty looks - Feb 2, 2006</title>
<text>No school, no books, no teacher's dirty looks By Traci Tamura and Thelma Gutierrez CNN "Unschooled" Nailah Ellis, 10, plays piano at home in Marietta, Georgia, while her mother Barbara watches. YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Manage Alerts | What Is This CNN -- It's a child's dream. Wake up whenever you want, with nobody telling you what to do and when to do it. And here's the kicker: No school to rush off to. Welcome to the world of "unschooling" -- an educational movement where kids, not parents, not teachers, decide what they will learn that day. "I don't want to sound pompous, but I think I am learning a little bit more, because I can just do everything at my own pace," said Nailah Ellis, a 10-year-old from Marietta, Georgia, who has been unschooled for most of her life. Nailah's day starts about 11 a.m., her typical wake-up time. She studies Chinese, reading, writing, piano and martial arts. But there's no set schedule. She works on what she wants, when she wants. She'll even watch some TV -- science documentaries are a favorite -- until her day comes to an end about 2 a.m. An extension of home-schooling, "unschooling" is when parents give their children total freedom to learn and explore whatever they choose. According to Holt Associates, an "unschooling" advocacy group, in 2005, about 150,000 children were unschooled, about 10 percent of the estimated 1.5 million home-schooled children in the United States. The term "unschooling" was first coined in 1977 by John Holt, an education reformer, the founder of Holt Associates and author of the book, "Teach Your Own." Holt felt traditional home-schooling didn't go far enough. He believed parents should not duplicate schools in their homes. He favored an education more freewheeling in nature, one that depends on the child for direction. The expectation is that along the way they will get an education. There are no mandatory books, no curriculum, no tests and no grades. Nailah's parents are in touch with the local school district and she takes the district's required tests. While "unschooling" could be characterized as the ultimate indulgence by a parent, Nailah's stay-at-home mother, Barbara Ellis, doesn't see it that way. "When you get to travel around, that's education to me. That's learning. You're doing it firsthand. You're not reading it from a book. You are not hearing it from a teacher," Ellis said. But proponents of the public education system suggest these children may be missing a key part of the educational experience. "There is nothing like the texture of kids having contact with each other, making friends and relating to different adults in a school setting," said David Tokofsky, a longtime educator and member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education. Nailah, who would be in 4th grade if she attended a regular school, seems to enjoy the "unschooled" lifestyle, even if she's a bit confused when asked what exactly she is learning. "I actually don't know what I'm learning," Nailah said. "I think I'm just having a good time." Story Tools</text>

<title>Homeschooling family loses asylum appeal - CNN.com</title>
<text>Homeschooling family loses asylum appeal By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer updated 5:15 PM EST, Mon March 3, 2014 CNN -- A German family that claims it will be persecuted for homeschooling if sent back, lost its asylum request Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court and could be deported. The justices, without comment, turned down the appeal of Uwe and Hannelore Romeike, who applied to stay in the United States on grounds of religious freedom. Keeping with their Christian beliefs, they are educating their five children at home. They said German law requires all children to attend public or state-approved private schools, and that such institutions "engendered a negative attitude toward family and parents and would tend to turn their children against Christian values." The Romeikes claimed German authorities threatened to take custody of their children if they did not comply. The family moved to east Tennessee six years ago and applied for asylum with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. An immigration judge initially granted their request in 2010 to the Romeikes and their children, saying they were "members of a particular social group" and would be punished for their religious beliefs if returned. But the Justice Department revoked it last year. The Board of Immigration Appeals concluded homeschoolers are too 'amorphous" to constitute a social group eligible for protection under the asylum law. "It was the last judicial hope for the family, but we will not give up," Michael Farris, the Romeike's lawyer, and chairman of the Virginia-based Home School Legal Defense Association. "Although our judicial efforts on behalf of this courageous family are over for now, we are resolved to fight on for them and homeschooling freedom," Farris said in a written statement. More than 127,250 people have so far signed an online White House petition requesting President Barack Obama grant the Romeikes asylum. The high court appeal was their last realistic chance to remain in the United States and the justices' refusal to intervene means removal proceedings by the federal government can resume. The case is Romeike v. Holder 13-471.</text>

<title>New York legalizes medical marijuana - CNN.com</title>
<text>New York legalizes medical marijuana By Lorenzo Ferrigno and Haimy Assefa, CNN updated 9:30 PM EDT, Tue July 8, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs a bill that allows medical marijuana use in nonsmokable form The state legislature passed the bill in June Under the bill, a doctor can prescribe marijuana to patients with serious conditions CNN -- New York became the latest state to permit the use of medical marijuana on Monday. At a news conference in New York City, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed the Compassionate Care Act, which allows doctors to prescribe marijuana in a nonsmokable form to patients with serious ailments that are recognized by the state on a predefined but flexible list of conditions. Dr. Gupta: I agree with Clinton on pot 'Doubling down' on medical marijuana The bill was passed by the State Assembly and Senate in June, said Jason Elan, a spokesman for Sen. Diane Savino, a sponsor of the bill. Cuomo said Monday that it was difficult to develop and pass the bill because it needed to embrace increased medical acceptance of marijuana while rejecting situations and conditions that state legislators said could have "good intent and bad results." "There is no doubt that medical marijuana can help people," Cuomo said Monday. "We are here to help people. And if there is a medical advancement, then we want to make sure that we're bringing it to New Yorkers." Senate Co-Leader Jeffrey D. Klein said the "patient-centric program" will provide relief to thousands of people and will be "one of the safest, most tightly regulated medical marijuana programs in the country." Could legalizing marijuana become 'tragedy' Pot farmers aiding California's drought The legalization of medical marijuana has had "overwhelming support" in state polls, State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has said in a statement. 'I like weed and I'm a good person': Pot smokers fight stereotypes Cuomo has said the act included criminal penalties in case a person tries to defraud the system, as well as a "fail safe" mechanism allowing the governor to "suspend the program at any time on recommendation of either the State Police Superintendent or the Commissioner of Health if there is a risk to the public health or public safety." New York will be the 23rd state, along with the District of Columbia, to allow medical marijuana in some form, according to information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures . Among the states that allow medical marijuana are Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey, each of which borders New York. The momentum has picked up recently, with most of these efforts taking effect over the past decade. A proponent of the measure, Missy Miller of Long Island, said she considered moving to California to gain access to a special strain of marijuana called Charlotte's Web oil, a derivative that may help cease her son Oliver's seizures. Oliver, 14, suffered a stroke in utero that resulted in a brain stem injury. Among several other life-threatening consequences are seizures, sometimes more than a dozen a day. "I am extremely relieved and proud to have been a part of helping bring necessary change that so many of us need," Miller said. But "I am quite concerned about the 18-month implementation, though, because Oliver does not have that time to wait. I am hopeful that some kind of expedited access plan can be worked out to help those with urgent need like Oliver." Opponents of the measure have said it was driven by politics. "I think serious questions can be raised about using a political vehicle to achieve the use of a prescribable medication in America," William Foster, president of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency, told CNN when the plan was unveiled in January.</text>

<title>Medical marijuana users at legal risk (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>Medical marijuana users caught in state-federal conflict By Steph Sherer updated 1:46 PM EDT, Fri September 5, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Steph Sherer: A grandfather faces 10-year sentence on marijuana charges She says conflicts between federal, state laws imperil medical marijuana users Sherer: Federal law should defer to states on the legality of medical marijuana Editor's note: Steph Sherer is founder and Executive Director of Americans for Safe Access, a national organization that seeks to promote safe and legal access to cannabis for therapeutic use and research. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely hers. CNN -- Ten years in prison seems like a life-changing sentence for most people, but for 70-year-old Larry Harvey, it would effectively be a death sentence. The grandfather and several members of his family are facing federal charges for something the state of Washington has considered legal for more than 15 years. Larry is a medical marijuana patient. He legally used cannabis to treat severe pain, caused by a lifetime of work as a commercial fisherman and long-haul truck driver. Larry and his wife, Rhonda, live in the mountains outside a tiny town called Kettle Falls, where they garden, hunt and fish for nearly all of their food. Cannabis was among the dozens of herbs that grew on their property. The tranquility was shattered on a hot August day in 2012, when armed state and federal agents stormed the Harvey homestead in the first of three raids, conducted at a big expense to taxpayers. Despite his poor health and low risk to society, Larry was handcuffed and sent to jail by the government, after prosecutors said guns were found along with the marijuana. By the time a judge released him 17 days later, Larry was unable to walk because of a severe gout flare-up caused by his lack of health care in jail and can now only walk very short distances. Steph Sherer Larry is the latest in a long line of desperately ill patients who have suffered enormously while enduring prosecution for medical marijuana. Jerry Duval, a dual transplant recipient from Michigan, is serving a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence at a federal medical prison. Aaron Sandusky, a provider from California, is locked up in Texas with a heart condition that could claim his life without proper medication. Tragically, best-selling author Peter McWilliams died from complications of HIV and cancer after the terms of his federal probation outlawed the use of cannabis. And there are, unfortunately, many others. Under federal law, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, a dangerous drug with no medical value. Yet 34 states, and the District of Columbia, protect qualified patients from arrest and prosecution for the possession of cannabis products in some way. Caught in the middle of the policy chasm are patients and care providers, who despite their compliance with state law, are nonetheless vulnerable to attack by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. In state court, defendants can mount a medical marijuana defense, but in federal court, such evidence is strictly forbidden, leaving patients like Larry Harvey with essentially no defense at all. Federal juries are never allowed to hear evidence about a patient-defendant's medical necessity. Life sentence for 7 pounds of marijuana Inflexible sentencing and drug trafficking laws make no distinction between medical marijuana patients and other users and continue to be used to throw these patients into prison with little remedy. Those who proceed to trial against these odds, do so at great peril and for that, Larry Harvey and the Kettle Falls 5 should be commended for standing up to the federal government. Dissatisfied with the status quo, the Obama administration has tried to reform policy on medical marijuana. From Department of Justice memoranda on the acceptance of state marijuana laws, to proposals for reforming the country's mandatory minimum sentencing laws, a seismic shift in public opinion appears to be taking place. Yet patients like Larry Harvey are still being prosecuted and imprisoned in stark contrast to the rhetoric coming out of the White House. At Americans for Safe Access, we have been fighting for change on the state and federal level for over 12 years. In an historic vote of 219-189, the Republican-led House passed a budget amendment in May to prohibit federal funds from being used to interfere in state medical marijuana programs. View my Flipboard Magazine. The House then made another unprecedented vote of 231-192 to restrict Department of Treasury funds from being used to prohibit or penalize a financial institution for providing services to state law-abiding marijuana-related businesses. Even though these measures still need approval in the Senate, they are bold votes coming from members of Congress in favor of policy change. But why stop there While it's true that such measures would better protect patients like Larry Harvey and the Kettle Falls 5, what this country needs is a comprehensive federal policy. We must take heed of the available and accessible science on the therapeutic efficacy of marijuana and reclassify it for medical use. We must also have an explicit federal policy deferring to state medical marijuana laws, and not just a one-year budget bill band-aid. A more permanent solution can be found in the pending Congressional bill , H.R. 689, the "States' Medical Marijuana Patient Protections Act," which would reclassify marijuana, encourage greater research, and leave enforcement up to the states. ASA has mobilized patient advocates to lobby Congress for action to resolve this. It's a commonsense approach to end the attacks on patients, and Congress appears poised to take action and to do the right thing.</text>

<text>Is medical marijuana safe for children By Maia Szalavitz, TIME.com updated 11:41 AM EST, Fri November 30, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Marijuana has shown anti-cancer activity in many early studies Experts warn that the effects of the drug on child development are unknown Marijuana can be addictive, but addiction rates are often lower than opioids TIME.com -- Like some cancer patients in states where it's allowed, Mykayla Comstock uses cannabis as part of her treatment. Comstock is 7-years old. Her mother, a long time advocate for medical use of the illegal drug, has been giving her a gram of oral cannabis oil every day. Despite the fact that medical marijuana is legal in Oregon, where Comstock lives, the idea of giving it to a child still gives pause to many adults who associate the drug with recreational use that breaks the law. As reported by ABC News , Mykayla was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in July. Against her doctor's wishes, her mother, Erin Purchase, began giving her lime-flavored capsules filled with cannabis oil after she had a poor response to her initial chemotherapy treatment. Her doctors suggested a bone marrow transplant, but while she was taking the medical marijuana, she went into remission in August. She continues to rely on cannabis to ease pain and nausea and her mother plans to continue giving her the drug during the additional two to three years of chemotherapy she still faces. Purchase believes that certain components in marijuana, which show anti-cancer activity in many early studies , helped spark the remission. Mykayla's current doctor knows she takes the capsules, but doesn't discuss the marijuana as part of her medical therapy. Dr. Gupta on medical marijuana Marijuana's highs and lows TIME.com: Marijuana in Colorado -- ready for business Experts like Igor Grant of the University of California's Center for Medical Cannabis Research warn that the effects of the drug on child development are unknown. But the same is true for other medications used to fight pain and nausea that are currently given to children with cancer, as well as for powerful antipsychotic drugs that are used in long term treatment of childhood mental illnesses. Opioid drugs like morphine and Oxycontin, which are sometimes used to treat the severe pain that accompanies life-threatening cancer and other diseases, for example, can cause overdoses . Although marijuana can be addictive, addiction rates are often lower than those to opioid drugs, and discontinuing opioids is associated with severe physical withdrawal symptoms not seen with marijuana. While opioids can cause nausea and vomiting, marijuana reduces the risk of these symptoms that frequently plague cancer patients as side effects of radiation or chemotherapy. Advocates like Purchase argue that if opioids are acceptable to treat youngsters' cancer pain, then marijuana should be as well. TIME.com: How cannabinoids may slow brain aging The American Academy of Pediatrics, however, disagrees, and opposes the use of marijuana to treat young children, citing its addictive potential and the many unknowns about how it may affect developing bodies. The Institute of Medicine IOM, a scientific group of experts consulted by Congress, analyzed the available data and since 1999 has acknowledged that certain legitimate medical uses of marijuana are worth additional study. While the panel noted that many effective treatments already exist to relieve nausea and cancer pain, it recognized that for some patients who may not respond to these therapies, the components in marijuana may be helpful. The group's main objection to the drug was its use in smoked preparations, which is not an issue in this case. The IOM's report highlights the need for much more research into understanding medicinal uses of marijuana -- including for which symptoms or conditions it might be most effective, and for which patients. Those concerns are magnified when it comes to treating children like Comstock, who often are not included in clinical trials because of their young age, and who may have many more years to contend with any possible side effects of the drug. Some experts point out that not all of marijuana's components, and their effects on the body, have been studied, not to mention well understood. Without more research, both doctors and parents will continue to face the difficult decision of giving youngsters a compound and hoping it will do more good than harm.

<title>CNN.com - Supreme Court allows prosecution of medical marijuana - Jun 6, 2005</title>
<text>Supreme Court allows prosecution of medical marijuana By Bill Mears Manage alerts | What is this WASHINGTON CNN -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled doctors can be blocked from prescribing marijuana for patients suffering from pain caused by cancer or other serious illnesses. In a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled the Bush administration can block the backyard cultivation of pot for personal use, because such use has broader social and financial implications. "Congress' power to regulate purely activities that are part of an economic 'class of activities' that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce is firmly established," Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, William Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas dissented. The case took an unusually long time to be resolved, with oral arguments held in November. The decision means that federal anti-drug laws trump state laws that allow the use of medical marijuana, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Ten states have such laws. "If medical marijuana advocates want to get their views successfully presented, they have to go to Congress; they can't go to the states, because it's really the federal government that's in charge here," Toobin said. At issue was the power of federal government to override state laws on use of "patient pot." The Controlled Substances Act prevents the cultivation and possession of marijuana, even by people who claim personal "medicinal" use. The government argues its overall anti-drug campaign would be undermined by even limited patient exceptions. The Drug Enforcement Agency began raids in 2001 against patients using the drug and their caregivers in California, one of 11 states that legalized the use of marijuana for patients under a doctor's care. Among those arrested was Angel Raich, who has brain cancer, and Diane Monson, who grew cannabis in her garden to help alleviate chronic back pain. A federal appeals court concluded use of medical marijuana was non-commercial, and therefore not subject to congressional oversight of "economic enterprise." But lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department argued to the Supreme Court that homegrown marijuana represented interstate commerce, because the garden patch weed would affect "overall production" of the weed, much of it imported across American borders by well-financed, often violent drug gangs. Lawyers for the patient countered with the claim that the marijuana was neither bought nor sold. After California's referendum passed in 1996, "cannabis clubs" sprung up across the state to provide marijuana to patients. They were eventually shut down by the state's attorney general. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2001 that anyone distributing medical marijuana could be prosecuted, despite claims their activity was a "medical activity." The current case considered by the justices dealt with the broader issue of whether marijuana users could be subject to prosecution. Along with California, nine states have passed laws permitting marijuana use by patients with a doctor's approval: Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Arizona also has a similar law, but no formal program in place to administer prescription pot. California's Compassionate Use Act permits patients with a doctor's approval to grow, smoke or acquire the drug for "medical needs." Users include television host Montel Williams, who uses it to ease pain from multiple sclerosis. Anti-drug activists say Monday's ruling could encourage abuse of drugs deemed by the government to be narcotics. "It's a handful of people who want to see not just marijuana, but all drugs legalized," said Calvina Fay of the Drug Free America Foundation. In its hard-line stance in opposition to medical marijuana, the federal government invoked a larger issue. "The trafficking of drugs finances the work of terror, sustaining terrorists," said President Bush in December 2001. Tough enforcement, the government told the justices, "is central to combating illegal drug possession." Marijuana users, in their defense, argued, "Since September 11, 2001, Defendants [DEA] have terrorized more than 35 Californians because of medical cannabis." In that state, the issue has become a hot political issue this election year. The case is Gonzales v. Raich, case no. 03-1454. Story Tools</text>

<title>Opinion: Be afraid of Big Marijuana - CNN.com</title>
<text>Be afraid of Big Marijuana By David Frum, CNN Contributor updated 9:17 AM EDT, Tue September 10, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS David Frum: In August, the Obama administration retreated on marijuana policy Frum: It's important to appreciate that "medical marijuana" is a laughable fiction He says the emerging marijuana industry will target young people and minorities Frum: It is a myth that marijuana is harmless and nonaddictive; we need better policy Editor's note: David Frum, a CNN contributor, is a contributing editor at The Daily Beast. He is the author of eight books, including a new novel, "Patriots," and a postelection e-book, "Why Romney Lost." Frum was a special assistant to President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2002. CNN -- "We're on the brink of creating Big Marijuana." That warning comes from my friend Kevin Sabet, a former senior adviser on drug control policy under President Barack Obama. Sabet now heads Smart Approaches to Marijuana , an anti-legalization group on whose board I sit. At the end of August, the administration that Sabet served announced a retreat on marijuana policy. It will allow the states of Washington and Colorado to proceed with the legal retailing of marijuana. And it will get out of the way of the approximately 20 states that allow so-called medical marijuana. With a referendum on marijuana scheduled in 2014 in Alaska and action likely in coming years in California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon, half the states in the union may soon allow the sale of marijuana to almost anybody determined to buy it. David Frum To understand where the marijuana debate is going, it's important to appreciate that "medical marijuana" is a laughable fiction. In California, the typical user of so-called medical marijuana is a 32-year-old white man with no life-threatening illness but a long record of substance abuse. Under Colorado's now-superseded medical marijuana regime, only 2% of those prescribed marijuana suffered from cancer, and only 1% from HIV/AIDS. Some 94% cited unspecified "pain" as the justification for their pot prescription. False patients find unscrupulous doctors: in Oregon, only 10 practitioners write the majority of all marijuana prescriptions in the state. When a TV crew visited a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles last year, they met for five minutes with a man who turned out to be licensed as an acupuncturist and were then handed a prescription signed by a doctor they never met. Sanjay Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed Where marijuana is allowed to be sold, somebody will sell it. As Sabet warns, the marijuana industry of the future is already taking form. In March of this year, Fortune magazine devoted its prestigious cover to the Arcview Group , an investor group seeking to capitalize on the emerging marijuana market. Warren Buffett famously explained the economics of tobacco: "It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. Plus, it's addictive!" Alcohol conforms to the same ugly logic. Half of all the alcohol consumed in the United States is consumed by underage and excessive drinkers . As one industry observer has bitterly remarked: "Regardless of its public stance, the industry considers underage and excessive drinking to be profit centers that need nurturing, rather than problems that need solving." Washington details pot sale rules Feds loosen marijuana enforcement Free pot handed out in Colorado Sabet foresees that the emerging marijuana industry will target the same populations as are targeted by the tobacco and alcohol industries -- young people and racial minorities -- and for the same reason: secure and contented people don't tend to be heavy consumers of psychoactive substances. Sabet has laid out a better vision of an effective national drug control policy in his new book, "Reefer Sanity." Sabet's message eschews punishment in favor of treatment; it replaces condemnation with compassion. But it understands the difference between compassion and credulity. Nobody ever helped a troubled person by accepting lies at face value. "Reefer Sanity" debunks seven myths about marijuana, beginning with the biggest myth of all: that this drug is harmless and nonaddictive. It's a message that is all the more timely in the face of last week's report by the Department of Health and Human Services that regular marijuana use surged over the half-decade from 2007 to 2012 . "Reefer Sanity" is the best explication I've seen of the errors on which the case for marijuana legalization has been built. It's a book that every concerned parent should read -- and that every advocate of legalization should be challenged to answer.</text>

<title>Melissa Etheridge: Medical marijuana should be legal - CNN.com</title>
<text>CNN -- Each day an estimated 6,000 Americans will try marijuana for the first time. It's the most common illicit drug in the United States with nearly 15 million people using it at least once a month. Melissa Etheridge took medical marijuana to help her through her chemotherapy. All this week, "Anderson Cooper 360" is taking a close look at the deeply divisive issue of drug legalization in a series of reports. It's a special "360" investigation called "America's High: The case for and against pot." The topic of medical marijuana inspires particular controversy. As of right now, 13 states have laws that permit marijuana, also know as cannabis, to be taken for medical conditions. There is no prescription for cannabis; instead doctors issue a recommendation in these states. But is it safe Is it effective Does it actually work Melissa Etheridge says it worked for her. The Grammy Award-winning singer- songwriter turned to marijuana after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004. In an interview, Etheridge talked to CNN's Anderson Cooper on why she did it and how she believes it helped restore her health. She's now pushing for its legalization. The following is an edited version of the interview. Melissa Etheridge: I'm actually grateful for my cancer diagnosis. Anderson Cooper: Grateful because it changed your life Etheridge: It changed my life; woke me up totally. Cooper: What is the pain [of chemotherapy] like Etheridge: It was just a general pain of your body dying, of all your cells dying. Your appetite is gone. And you are nauseous. And your hair is falling out. Your skin -- it's like death. And the only thing I could do is lay there. I can't -- it hurt to -- light hurt, sound hurt. I couldn't read anything. I just laid there. Etheridge didn't want to use Vicodin or other prescription pills, she said. All of these things have side effects. So, the steroids and the pain relief that they give you on that first day when you go into chemotherapy causes constipation. So they will -- here is a pill for the constipation which will give you diarrhea. And you get huge side effects from all of this. Cooper: The first time you did [marijuana], it made a big difference Etheridge: Instantly -- and instantly within a minute relieves the nausea, relieves the pain. And all of a sudden I was normal. You don't take medicinal marijuana to get high. Cooper: So you weren't getting high Etheridge: No you don't get a high. No it's not a high. It was normal. And I could -- all of a sudden I could get out of bed. I could go see my kid. And it was amazing. Etheridge often didn't smoke; the marijuana was mixed into butter and spread on food, or run through a vaporizer. Cooper: Did you ever worry about becoming addicted They were saying this is a gateway drug Etheridge: No. Not at all. If you were on that side, you would understand what I mean. It is almost laughable to think that you could be addicted. This is not at all. Cooper: You mention you still have a prescription. Do you still use marijuana Etheridge: Yes, I do. The effects on my gastrointestinal system leave me with a real intolerance for acid of any kind, and so acid reflux is a constant problem. I don't want to take the little pills that they give you that have all the side effects to help with that. And I do use it -- I'm one of the users that would like in a stressful situation or maybe when I've eaten that cheese pizza with my kids that I will do that and it settles -- totally completely settles all that. Cooper: Most people eat the cheese pizza after the marijuana. Etheridge: That is true. Cooper: You've got it backwards. Etheridge: No. It's not like that. I know. Cooper: There's more than, I think, 200,000 people in California who are registered to receive medicinal marijuana. Do you really believe that all those people though have legitimate reasons to be getting marijuana Etheridge: Yes. Who are we to say what a legitimate reason is If it helps somebody at the end of the day instead of drinking a couple of glasses of wine, to have a few tokes, who are we to say Why must we in this country be so judgmental about this These people are not hurting anybody. They are not hurting themselves.</text>
