<title>Belgium: Lawmakers vote on children's right to choose euthanasia - CNN.com</title>
<text>Belgium: Lawmakers vote for children's 'right to die' euthanasia law By Laura Smith-Spark and Diana Magnay, CNN updated 1:22 PM EST, Thu February 13, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Lower house of Parliament votes 86 to 44 in favor NEW: Open letter signed by 175 pediatricians called for more time to consider the issue The law would allow terminally ill minors who are in intolerable pain to choose euthanasia Stringent conditions would have to be met, including consent by the child's parents CNN -- Does a terminally ill child in intolerable pain have a right to die Belgian lawmakers said yes. The lower house of the Belgian Parliament adopted a bill that extends the right to euthanasia for minors, the Parliament said Thursday on its official Twitter account. The law passed 86 to 44 with 12 abstentions. That followed a vote by the country's Senate in December supporting the measure. The next step would see the bill go to the king, Philippe, to be signed into law. The euthanasia bill is widely supported -- but has stoked fierce opposition from critics. Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in "constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated." Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. The new bill would extend the "right to die" to those under the age of 18 only under certain strict conditions, including that the child is judged able to understand what euthanasia means. Consent of parents or guardians must also be given. Belgium's controversial euthanasia law Professor: Doctors should not be killing Belgian lawmaker backs child euthanasia law Mother Linda van Roy, from Schilde, Belgium, is among those backing the bill. She could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby, Ella-Louise, in the last hours of her life. Ella-Louise, who was 10 months old when she died just over two years ago, would never have qualified for euthanasia. But her mother had to watch as her baby -- who had Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system -- slowly faded away under palliative sedation, food and liquid withheld so her suffering was not further prolonged. Children should 'have a choice' "That whole period of sedation, you always need to give more and more medication, and you start asking questions. And you say, 'What's the use of keeping this baby alive' " van Roy said. She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. That's why she's campaigning for a change to Belgium's euthanasia laws, to give the choice of ending their suffering to older children whose bodies are wracked with pain. "We want for those children to be able to talk about euthanasia and to ask those questions and if they really want to say, 'Stop, this is it, I don't want it anymore,' that they can have a choice," van Roy said. Pediatrician Gerlant van Berlae of the Free University of Brussels is among the medical professionals backing the change in the law. He told CNN that in practice it would make little difference. Ethics of euthanasia Deaf twins choose death over blindness "Doctors do terminate lives, of children as well as adults," he said. "But today it is done in, let's say, a 'gray zone,' or in the dark, because it is illegal." Pediatricians: No urgent need for this law However, 175 pediatricians signed an open letter Thursday urging more time for reflection before any decision is made. The letter argues that the law "responds to no real demand" and that most medical teams caring for terminally ill children would recognize that none of their patients has made a spontaneous and voluntary demand for euthanasia. Meanwhile, medical advances mean that effective palliative care is available and that children do not suffer as they approach death. Extending the "right to die" to minors will only add to the stress and pain of families at a difficult time, it said. The letter also questions how any objective judgment can be made on a child's ability to understand what's at stake. The political process has created a "false impression" that a change to the law is urgently needed -- but in reality "the situation in our country is far from being dramatic," the doctors say. Others also question whether children have the capacity to take this most final of decisions for themselves. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, told CNN she is concerned that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that it would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. 'If you leave, you leave forever' Izabela Sacewicz has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Having recently turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. "Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God," she says. "But if you leave, you leave forever." Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. "Do you think it's good, or not good" her mother asks. "It's not good," she replies, the words barely audible. Iwona says that with enough support, no parent would think of euthanasia -- and that Belgium's lawmakers should instead focus on providing better support for families caring for terminally ill children. Supporters insist the measure is more a matter of principle than anything else -- and that only a small number of children will ever, in practice, ask to end their lives through euthanasia. Under its strict guidelines, no doctor would be forced to carry out euthanasia against his or her will and the child would always have the option of palliative treatment. A child psychologist or psychiatrist would have to examine the child to make sure he or she is capable of making the decision. In the Netherlands, where children have been able to request euthanasia with parental consent since 2002, only five children have ever done so.</text>

<title>Euthanasia: Hope you never need it, but be glad the option is there - CNN.com</title>
<text>Euthanasia: Hope you never need it, but be glad the option is there By Dr. Philip Nitschke, pro-euthanasia advocate, Special to CNN updated 12:29 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 The controversial case of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson revived the euthanasia debate in the UK. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Belgian MPs may allow terminally ill children and those with dementia access to euthanasia Pro-euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke says debate must avoid moral panic, dogma Nitschke: If a patient's suffering cannot be relieved, what should the State do "I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws, but draw comfort from them" Editor's note: Dr. Philip Nitschke is the director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International and author of the Peaceful Pill Handbook . Follow him on Twitter @philipnitschke . The opinions expressed in this article are solely his. CNN -- The time was always going to come when society would need to face the pointy end of the voluntary euthanasia debate: Those hard cases that would challenge most people's support for the issue, the cases and circumstances which constitute never-before trodden ground. While in most Western countries polls repeatedly show strong community support for a terminally ill person's right to obtain medical assistance to die, the results would likely be quite different if the person involved was not an adult, was not of sound mind or was not, in the strictest sense, terminally ill. As Belgium decides whether to extend the right to euthanasia to those who have Alzheimer's and to children, the sharp end of the debate is staring us all in the face, regardless of where we live. The euthanasia argument is about to escalate to heights unknown: We will all be challenged about how to have a good debate, a rational debate as members of the human race, and in being challenged, we must guard against the moral panic that this issue will inevitably throw up. The issues on the table are too important for hysterical indignation and fundamental religious dogma. We are all grown-ups. The debate we are set to have -- some two decades after the world's first right to die law was passed in Australia's Northern Territory -- should be grown-up too, even if some of the stakeholders we are about to discuss are not. Historically, children and people with Alzheimer's are two segments of the community that have been viewed as having little or no agency, something that is referred to as 'capacity' in legal terms. Generally speaking, neither group has been held to be competent to make decisions that would be in their best interests. Yet this is what the Belgians are now planning. The opposite view: Euthanasia - we can live without it... For many in the ageing population, there are few fears which top that of getting dementia. Anyone who has watched a loved family member sink into the abyss of confusion and disorientation will know the utter terror that can accompany the process, as the person in question tries to juxtapose moments of clarity with the awfulness of knowing one's grip on reality -- and with it one's dignity and sense of self -- is slipping. Deaf twins choose death over blindness The case in support of euthanasia The case against assisted suicide A plea for the right to assisted suicide In New Zealand earlier this year, the Labor Member of Parliament Maryan Street paved the way with her private members bill which, if passed, would allow New Zealanders to include an assisted suicide in their Living Will. For those who may find themselves with Alzheimer's in future, this inclusion would be a valuable pre-planning tool: "If I do get dementia, at least the children will know what I want. I can now rest assured that my wishes not to live "like that" will be respected." Within the membership of Exit International , this is a common sentiment. So too is the wish not to waste government money keeping the demented elderly alive in the nation's care homes if that is not how, when they could communicate, they said they wanted to spend their last days. On the topic of children, the debate is a little easier. Some children do develop terminal illnesses and do die well before their time. It is not impossible for such young people to have a well-developed sense of their own mortality. While the Belgians will likely structure legislative developments in this area with stringent safeguards, it is the practice of forcing terminally-ill children to battle on in spite of an appalling prognosis, trying to make it to 18, that is driving the agenda. For both groups, the Belgians are bravely tackling difficulties emerging in their existing legislation, current laws that are quite obviously inadequate, even cruel, in certain circumstances. Unless modern medicine has a cure for Alzheimer's and any number of the terminal illnesses that confront children, the current situation is that they will keep suffering. If suffering cannot be relieved, the question then becomes: what should the State do Should we all be forced to live on regardless of the quality of life that confronts us Or, should legislation be extended to ensure dignity and choice for all At Exit International our motto is "a peaceful death is everybody's right." Somehow the tagline "a peaceful death is everybody's right unless you are a child or a teenager or have dementia, in which case tough luck!" doesn't have the same appeal or the same logic. The Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking and acting -- in the cold light of day, the morality of their intentions is not that challenging when the alternatives are considered. As a son to my aged mother and as a grandfather to my son's three boys, I welcome the type of society that the Belgians are proposing. Of course, I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws. But I draw great comfort from knowing they are there all the same.</text>

<title>Belgium: Lawmakers back allowing minors to request euthanasia - CNN.com</title>
<text>Belgium: Lawmakers back allowing minors to request euthanasia By Laura Smith-Spark and Diana Magnay, CNN updated 12:27 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 A nurse puts a respiratory mask on a baby at the Queen Fabiola Children's Hospital in Brussels on November 25, 2013. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A Belgian Senate panel votes in favor of a law extending euthanasia rights to children The bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law If passed, under-18s could request euthanasia only under stringent conditions Belgium passed a law allowing euthanasia for adults in 2002 CNN -- A controversial bill that would extend the right to request euthanasia to children suffering terminal illnesses and adults with dementia cleared a vote in a Belgian Senate committee Wednesday. The panel voted 13-4 to allow minors to seek euthanasia under certain conditions, the communications director for the Senate, Patrick Peremans, told CNN. The vote is one stage in a legislative process -- the bill must clear other hurdles before it becomes law. Belgium passed legislation in 2002 allowing voluntary euthanasia for adults. Changes to the law now being considered by lawmakers would allow under-18s to request an end to their life only under stringent guidelines. Deaf twins choose death over blindness 2012: A plea for the right to assisted suicide Dr. Kenneth Chambarae, who is part of the end-of-life research group at Brussels' Free University, specializing in the impact of legalized euthanasia, said the bill explicitly states that it would be possible only for competent minors suffering unbearable physical pain from a serious physical illness without prospect of improvement to request euthanasia. This is different from adults, who can also request it if they are suffering psychologically. Chambarae argues the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else -- that very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. The bill will now be introduced in the Senate, where it will be debated in a plenary meeting by all senators, Peremans said. If the bill is voted against, this would mean the end of the measure. If it passes, the bill would then be transferred to the House of Representatives for debate. If approved there, it would go to the king to be signed into law. 'Grey zone' Earlier this month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Among them was Gerland van Berlaer, also from Brussels' Free University. "Doctors do terminate lives of children as well as adults," he told CNN. "But today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal. And this means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way." Dr. Philip Nitschke, director of pro-euthanasia group Exit International, told CNN the Belgians are to be applauded for their progressive thinking on a very difficult issue. However, critics question whether children are capable of making an informed decision on whether to end their own lives. The Netherlands already allows children over the age of 12 to request euthanasia with the consent of their parents. Since the law was introduced in 2002, only five children have chosen to die that way.</text>

<text>Parents plead to be able to help terminally ill children die By Diana Magnay, CNN updated 3:39 PM EST, Wed November 27, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Belgian MPs are debating extending the law on euthanasia to terminally ill children Linda van Roy, whose baby daughter died of degenerative condition, wants law changed Supporters say euthanasia would only be chosen by very small number of minors Euthanasia opponents want more of a focus on palliative care and pain relief Interactive: Find out where euthanasia is legal around the world . Brussels, Belgium CNN -- As little Ella-Louise faded away, her tiny, frail body wracked with pain, her heartbroken mother was left to look on, feeling powerless. Linda van Roy says she could do nothing to help her terminally ill baby in the last hours of her life. "In that period, they tell you it's best not to give any fluids, because babies survive on little drops of liquid," she said. "So we stopped feeding her. In the end, it was bones and skin and no more baby left." Ten-month-old Ella-Louise died two years ago with Krabbe disease, a rare and terminal genetic mutation that damages the nervous system. In the final days of Ella-Louise's life, when she was being given palliative sedation, van Roy, of Schilde, Belgium, says she could still see the agony on her daughter's face. Deaf twins choose death over blindness The case in support of euthanasia The case against assisted suicide A plea for the right to assisted suicide "She died on Tuesday; on Monday, we saw on her face that she was still in pain. And then you start to get angry, because you know that there is no medication left to give her to take away that pain." She wishes she could have administered a fatal dose of medication to make the end of her daughter's short life come more quickly. Unbearable suffering Belgium legalized euthanasia in 2002 for those in "constant and unbearable physical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated." Minors were included in the original proposals but were left out of the final legislation for political reasons. Now, the country's lawmakers are debating a bill which would extend the "right to die" to those under the age of 18 who are terminally ill and in intolerable physical pain. The bill cleared a senate committee vote on Wednesday; it must clear several other hurdles before becoming law. Since Ella-Louise was only a baby, her case would never have qualified for euthanasia. Under the current rules, the patient must be able to make a repeated request for euthanasia themselves while experiencing unbearable suffering of which there is no prospect for improvement. But van Roy believes that children, and parents of sick babies, should have more options, including the right to choose when to die. "We want those children to be able to talk about euthanasia, and if they really want to say: 'Stop, this is it. I don't want it anymore,' we want people to have a choice," she said. Polls show the majority of Belgians agree with the principle of offering euthanasia to children. The current debate is less about whether or not to extend the legislation and more about what conditions to apply to the law: from what age euthanasia should be available and whether that should be with or without parental consent. Parental consent This month, 16 pediatricians wrote an open letter in two national newspapers demanding an extension of the practice. Gerlant van Berlaer from the Free University Brussels was one of them. "Doctors do terminate the lives of children as well as adults, but today it's done in a gray zone or in the dark because it's illegal," he said. "This means that there's a lot of room to do things the wrong way." Van Berlaer stresses that only a tiny number of children would ever choose to end their lives this way: children with cancer, for example, who are still in charge of their cognitive faculties but in terrible pain. Kenneth Chambaere is a researcher at the Free University Brussels focusing on end-of-life care and euthanasia. He has compared end of life practice in Flanders before and after euthanasia was legalized in 2002, to gauge whether there has been a slippery slope. He says his research shows that although the number of euthanasia requests has gone up, from 1.1% before 2002 to 1.9% by 2008, the number of instances in which doctors have hastened the end of life without patient consent has gone down considerably. And he says minors are only a very small fraction of those deaths in any case. "People dying underage mostly die of accidents or trauma, so very sudden deaths where no end-of-life decision making is possible," he said. "And a euthanasia request is very rare in those patients." Chambaere argues that the debate in Belgium is more one of principle than anything else; only very few children would ever choose euthanasia but that the law now discriminates against them. Palliative care Experiences in the Netherlands, where patients older than 12 are allowed to request euthanasia with their parents' consent, would seem to support this: Only five children have chosen to die by euthanasia since the law was introduced in 2002. But critics say children cannot reasonably decide whether to end their own lives. Palliative nurse Sonja Develter, who specializes in end-of-life care for children, says that among the 200 children she's nursed to their deaths, she's never met a child who asked for death to come early. "The main concern for children is always for the family," she said. "It's difficult for a child, because he feels he's slipping away, but he cannot tell his parents as that's not what they want to hear. "Children say to me, 'It's not difficult to die, but please look after my parents.' " Develter worries that giving children a choice would mean they made decisions based on what they thought their families wanted to hear, and that this would be a terrible strain for children who may already feel they are a burden to their caregivers. One of Sonja's patients is Izabela Sacewicz, who has Huntington's disease, a neurological disease that drastically reduces life expectancy in children. Eight years ago, she was a bubbling, active child -- top of her class, according to her mother, Iwona. Now, having just turned 18, she can't eat or walk without help. She finds it difficult to speak, but her mind is still her own. In a painful exchange, her mother explains to her what euthanasia is, using the simplest terms she can think of. "Euthanasia means if you are unwell, you are so unhappy that you don't want to stay here, you want to leave, to go high up to God," she said. "But if you leave, you leave forever." Izabela listens, the strain showing on her face. "Do you think it's good or not good" her mother asks. "It's not good." The words are barely audible. CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.

<text>Comatose woman in euthanasia debate dies Story Highlights NEW: Woman in coma for 17 years in Italy has died, her father says Eluana Englaro has been in vegetative state since a car crash Her father has fought for years to have her feeding tube removed By Alessio Vinci CNN ROME, Italy CNN -- An Italian woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose right-to-die case was being debated in the Italian Parliament has died days after doctors began removing her feeding tube. A portrait of Eluana Englaro. She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro, 37, Monday night, then called for a moment of silence in the chamber. Even as the silence ended, one legislator declared, "She has not died -- she was killed," prompting other right-to-die opponents to join in with calls of "Murderers!" Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash, when she was 20 years old. For years, Englaro's father, Beppino, fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state. Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: "Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further. I need to be left alone." But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on. When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes. Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament. Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal. Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process. A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy's Council of Ministers, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort. "I will do everything I can to save her life," Berlusconi said. "We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying." But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree. According to a statement from Napolitano's office, "An emergency decree cannot be in contrast with a court decision." The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence. Earlier this month, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that "euthanasia is a false solution to suffering." Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive. "It is the duty of the doctors, of society, and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive. No one has the right to take her life away from her," he said. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment. It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.</text>

<title>CNN - Kevorkian charged with murder in euthanasia case - November 25, 1998</title>
<text>Kevorkian charged with murder in euthanasia case Prosecutors take doctor up on challenge Gorcyca is charging Kevorkian with murder   November 25, 1998 Web posted at: 4:12 p.m. EST 2112 GMT PONTIAC, Michigan CNN -- Setting up a high-profile legal battle over euthanasia and assisted suicide, Michigan authorities charged Dr. Jack Kevorkian with first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian was expected to turn himself in to Oakland County authorities Wednesday afternoon, and he was expected to be arraigned a short time later. Oakland County prosecutor David Gorcyca said he acted after viewing the raw videotape, provided by CBS, of Kevorkian injecting the patient, Thomas Youk, with a drug that killed him. An edited version was aired Sunday night on the CBS news program "60 Minutes." Gorcyca said he would seek no bond for Kevorkian, citing a past incident in which the retired pathologist appeared in court during the day and dropped off a body at the coroner's office that same night. Along with the murder charge, Kevorkian is charged with criminal assistance to a suicide and delivery of a controlled substance. Prosecutors confident of conviction Gorcyca said there was not a contradiction in charging Kevorkian with both murder and assisted suicide, and said prosecutors felt they could convict on both counts. "Not withstanding public sentiment on the issue of assisted suicide, it's incumbent upon me to make charging decisions solely on the law and not emotion or sympathy," Gorcyca said. "In this case there's an obvious violation of the law that I won't turn my back to," he said. He cited a Michigan law that went into effect this year, making it illegal to plan or participate in an assisted suicide. The prosecutor defended his decision not to charge the doctor until seeing the unedited videotape. Gorcyca had said Monday that he would not be "baited" into a charge without having all the evidence. "It was vital that a decision be made only after all the facts were known," he said. Gorcyca also told reporters several times that it would make no difference that Houck wanted to die. "Consent is not a viable defense in taking a life of another, even under the most controlled environment," he said. "I doubt there will come a case where there presents itself such convincing evidence of these crimes as depicted on videotape and in conjunction with admissions to having committed these crimes," Gorcyca said. "Our proofs are strong." Kevorkian dared prosecutors to charge him Kevorkian at an earlier trial on charges stemming from assisted suicide   Kevorkian staged the "60 Minutes" interview in hopes that authorities would charge him and force a legal showdown over assisted suicide and euthanasia. He told CBS' Mike Wallace if he was held in jail he would go on a hunger strike. He already has been acquitted at three earlier trials. In an interview with the Oakland Press published Monday, Kevorkian said he would give Gorcyca a week to take action. "Either charge me within a week, or I will resume my practice, and resist with all my power any attempt to arrest or hinder me," he told the paper. The 70-year-old retired pathologist has admitted helping more than 130 people end their lives. But Kevorkian said it was the first time he himself had directly administered the fatal dose. In Sunday night's broadcast, reporter Mike Wallace asked Kevorkian, "You killed him" "I did," Kevorkian replied. "But it could be manslaughter, not murder. It's not necessarily murder. But it doesn't bother me what you call it. I know what it is. This could never be a crime in any society which deems itself enlightened." During the "60 Minutes" broadcast, Youk's family said he had suffered terrible pain from his disease. "I was so grateful to know that someone would relieve him of his suffering," Youk's wife, Melody, said. "I don't consider it murder. I consider it the way things should be." The family had written to Kevorkian, who videotaped his first meeting with them. That videotape was also broadcast by "60 Minutes" and showed Kevorkian explaining to Youk what he wanted to do, then asking for and receiving his written consent. "I had him sign a thing that he chose direct injection, and he signed it," Kevorkian said. He said he felt sure he did not force Youk to agree. Reuters contributed to this report.

<title>CNN.com - Spanish film put focus on euthanasia - Mar 23, 2005</title>
<text>Spanish film put focus on euthanasia By CNN's Al Goodman Ramon Sampedro was played in the film by actor Javier Bardem. VIDEO The political and rhetorical lines drawn in the battle over Terri Schiavo may not be as clear as they appear. Manage alerts | What is this MADRID, Spain CNN -- The film "Mar Adentro" -- or "The Sea Inside" -- tells the true story of a quadriplegic who wanted to end his life, and in the process became Spain's most famous case of euthanasia. The movie asks: Did this man, Ramon Sampedro, have the right to say his life belonged to him, and no-one else Director Alejandro Amenabar said: "What we wanted to show was that this man, after 30 years, decides he wants to die and he doesn't seem to us like someone who was unstable, as some people have suggested." Ramon Sampedro was paralyzed below the neck in a diving accident. He was able to smoke only if someone put a cigarette in his mouth, as depicted in the film. He learned how to write holding a pen between his teeth. And he went to court to ask for the right to commit assisted suicide. His plea was rejected. But he got friends to help anyway. In January 1998, he was videotaped drinking poison -- and making his final statement: "You have liberated me from the most humiliating of slaveries, being a live head stuck to a dead body." Socialist party official Matilde Valentin says there are no plans to legalize assisted suicide in Spain -- but nor does she agree with the way the Schiavo case has been handled. "Suddenly the president and the Congress pass a law to change the legal situation. These hurried decisions, without consensus, can't solve the problem," he said. Various opinion polls in the past decade have shown a majority of Spaniards favor decriminalizing assisted suicide. In one poll even a majority of Spanish doctors say terminally ill patients should have the option of euthanasia. On the streets of Madrid, the consensus seems to be against prolonging life unnaturally. The Catholic Church says that God's will must be allowed to prevail. Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, of the Spanish Bishops Conference, said: "The position of the church is that death cannot be provoked. Nor can it be absurdly delayed. Death has its time -- its natural time." Ramon Sampedro chose his time. Terri Schiavo has no such power. Story Tools</text>
