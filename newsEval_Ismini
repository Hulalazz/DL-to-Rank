<title>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion: a polarizing, emotional debate 41 years after court ruling By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN updated 8:56 PM EST, Wed January 22, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS This week is the 41st anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision The abortion issue is just as contentious as it was in 1973 The Pope tweeted his sentiments as thousands of pro-life marchers rallied in Washington Abortion remains a hot-button political issue at the federal and state levels Washington CNN -- The abortion issue is far from settled. It's just as contentious today as it has ever been in the United States. Wednesday's 41st anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court case, Roe v. Wade, which upheld legalized abortion before about 24 weeks, ignited the polarized, emotional battle. What's happening In sum, the Pope tweeted, thousands gathered, politicians pontificated. Anti-abortion activists have a bigger megaphone as it has come to remember the day they say the unborn lost their rights. Thousands of anti-abortion activists convened on the National Mall in the annual "March for Life" rally that drew buses of activists. This year they braved the snow that fell Tuesday and below freezing temperatures that followed. Pope Francis showed his solidarity , tweeting "I join the March for Life in Washington with my prayers. May God help us respect all life, especially the most vulnerable." Politicians sent releases, including Sen. Ted Cruz. "Every human life is a precious gift from God, and our law should protect innocent human life," the Texas Republican said. What's changed Thousands converge for March on Life GOP plans on using abortion in 2014 Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape GOP tackles the abortion war In the abortion debate, each side tries to out maneuver the other. But the game is becoming more intense, complicated and consuming. Opinion: Why progressives should be pro-life Both sides are working at the local, state and federal level to pass laws. Obviously the anti-choice advocates want laws that restrict access to abortion while pro-choice proponents are working for measures that increase access to abortion care and options. Both sides are focusing on the court system, too, working to place judges that have a tremendous amount of clout in shutting down or allowing abortion-related laws. Who's winning The answer is not so cut and dry, but last year was a big year for anti-choice advocates. Even the president of one of the largest women's rights groups admitted that the anti-choice side made some inroads. "Things are in a crisis," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said. "The number of bills that have moved in the state legislature are definitely concerning." According to the group, 24 states adopted 53 anti-choice measures in 2013, including one in North Dakota that outlaws abortion as early as six weeks of gestation. Effectively outlawing abortion as many women don't know they are pregnant at six weeks. On the flip side, 10 states have adopted only 16 pro-choice measures, mostly involving access to care and contraception. What's Congress doing about it Not much. But efforts are in motion. After Republicans gained the majority in the House in 2010, they have been working to roll back access to abortion. Republican lawmakers launched a comprehensive attack on Planned Parenthood, women's health clinics that provide abortion services, working to cut their federal funding. The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, caused major debates over abortion as opponents said it allows federal funding to be used for abortion services or providers who offer them. Supporters disagree as Democrats agreed to tighten language. The House passed the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act" that restricts abortions at 20 weeks, citing evidence that fetus feel pain at that time. But the measure is stalled in the Senate and President Barack Obama has vowed to veto it should it reach his desk. Does politics have anything to do with it Free Speech vs. Abortion Rights Dissecting the pope's in-depth interview Everything. While it won't make a campaign, it can surely break it. The Republican National Committee, which is holding its annual conference this week, put its events on hold and encouraged members to attend the "March for Life" rally. Abortion is a key topic of this year's meeting as a coalition of RNC members are introducing a resolution that encourages Republican candidates to "support Republican pro-life candidates who fight back against Democratic deceptive 'war on women' rhetoric by pointing out the extreme positions on abortion held by Democratic opponents." First on CNN: GOP urges candidates to stand ground on abortion It spurred Texas gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis' campaign. The issue launched her to political notoriety after she mounted a filibuster in the Texas legislature opposing restrictive abortion measures. But since she launched her candidacy, she's had to talk about a lot more than the abortion. Democrats are willing to highlight the issue when it frames Republican positions on abortion as extreme. "Last year, the GOP said they needed to reach out to women, but instead they've decided their plan is to spend more time fighting to restrict the rights of women to make their own health care choices," Democratic National Committee chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. Rarely do candidates run on the issue and win. But the issue can doom candidates who make controversial remarks. In 2012, Missouri Senate hopeful Todd Akin's campaign took a nose dive after the Republican, who opposes abortion in all circumstances, made incendiary remarks. Democrats have worked to optimize Republican stances on abortion. They say the Republicans have launched a "war on women" and pounded the issue in campaign ads and stump speeches. Do people care Yes and no. While it's a topic that evokes strong opinions, it's unlikely that people will pick a candidate solely on the issue. According to a May CNN poll, 25% of people thought abortion should be legal in all circumstances compared to 20% thought it should be legal in no situation. A Gallup Poll released last week found that respondents thought abortion was one of the least important issues that the government address. It came in 17 out of 19 topics. What's next The Supreme Court is hearing three cases involving the issue, including McCullen v. Coakley, which challenges the buffer zone law in Massachusetts that creates a safe space around reproductive health care facilities. And there's also the Hobby Lobby case , which will be heard this spring. The chain store has asked the court to exempt it from providing contraception and "abortion-inducing drug" health coverage to their workers, which is required under the Affordable Care Act. And lawmakers will continue the battle around the country.</text>

<title>Abortion law ruling a win for women (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>Abortion law ruling a win for women By John C. Jennings updated 8:36 PM EDT, Mon August 4, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS John Jennings: Court strikes down Alabama law that erects barriers for abortion doctors He says law purported to protect women, but instead bars them from medical care Hospital privileges requirement an anti-abortion ruse. Abortion a very safe procedure, he says Jennings: Legislators who truly care about women's safety will work to prevent these laws Editor's note: John C. Jennings is president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- On Monday, a federal court struck down Alabama's medically unnecessary law that singles out doctors who provide abortions and requires them to secure admitting privileges at a local hospital. The court called the justification for the law "exceedingly weak." As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I couldn't agree more. This decision is an important win for American women and for the practice of medicine. John C. Jennings Let me be clear: We all want women to receive safe medical care. But these laws a number of states have adopted them do not make women safer. In fact, they have quite the opposite effect, as they will make it harder for women to access medical care, potentially forcing them to seek abortion services later in their pregnancy. These laws also jeopardize women's safety by forcing qualified physicians to stop providing abortions for reasons having nothing whatsoever to do with medical safety. That is why leading medical groups like the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association oppose them. Whether a physician who provides abortions has hospital admitting privileges is not a reflection on the physician's ability to provide quality abortion care. While hospital privileges in theory should be awarded based on physician competency, they in fact are often denied for reasons unrelated to the physician's medical qualifications. For example, to obtain privileges, hospitals often require physicians to admit a certain number of patients each year. But doctors who provide abortions will likely never admit the minimum number of patients because complications are very, very rare. View my Flipboard Magazine. Here's what is important to remember: Abortion is already extremely safe, and for the vast majority of abortions, hospitals do not need to play a role in the patient's care. Abortion has a more than 99% safety record, with a less than 0.3% risk of complications that could merit hospital treatment. More than 90% of abortions in the United States are performed in outpatient settings and almost all the complications that do arise can be treated on an outpatient basis. It's one of the safest medical procedures performed in the United States today, period. In the exceedingly rare event of a complication, women's health centers have procedures in place to ensure that a woman gets the care she needs. Admitting privileges -- or lack thereof -- don't have any effect on a woman's ability to receive emergency care if she needs it. In our modern care delivery model, emergency room physicians, hospitalists and hospital staff are trained to identify and treat all these types of patient situations. Mississippi puts 'personhood' on ballot Court strikes down abortion buffer zones Even procedures with much higher rates of complication and mortality, such as colonoscopy, are not subject to these burdensome requirements because it's clear that they are not needed to keep patients safe. These baseless restrictions serve solely to prevent qualified, competent physicians from providing safe abortion care to women who need it. To put it simply, there is no medical reason to treat abortion providers any differently than other medical professionals. As the Alabama court found, the law would have forced all but two health centers in the entire state to stop providing abortions. A similar law in Mississippi would force the last remaining clinic in the state to shut its doors, leaving women in the state with no place to safely end a pregnancy. Similar requirements have devastated women and families in Texas and threaten to close clinics in Oklahoma, Louisiana and Wisconsin. These laws are clearly not motivated by women's safety, but by making access to safe, legal abortion difficult -- even impossible. Monday's court opinion recognizes that a woman is safest when she can make the decision about abortion with her family in consultation with her doctor, free from political interference. It clears one obstacle in the path of women -- and their doctors -- in Alabama. In states across the nation, legislators who truly care about women's safety would do well to work to eliminate unfounded restrictions to abortion, instead of continuing to introduce them.</text>

<title>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Spain 'heading for self-made mess' with abortion ban By Ann Furedi, abortion charity CEO, Special to CNN updated 8:31 AM EST, Tue February 18, 2014 Women protest in Madrid against the proposed changes to Spain's abortion law . STORY HIGHLIGHTS Spain's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape victims or women who would suffer lasting harm It would effectively reverse a 2010 law allowing abortion on request for the first 14 weeks Ann Furedi says Spanish woman would have to travel to other countries for terminations Furedi says women should be able to make a decision in line with their own moral values Editor's note: Ann Furedi is the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service -- a registered charity and the largest single abortion provider in the UK. It also offers other services such as pregnancy testing, counseling and STI screening. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. For a contrasting view point, click here. CNN -- Spain's controversial, and highly restrictive, new abortion law is now before Parliament, with approval looming . If passed this would mean that abortions will be permitted in only two circumstances: rape, and risk of "lasting harm" to the mother's health. The move would effectively reverse the abortion law of 2010, which permitted abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and up to 22 weeks where there was serious risk of fetal anomaly. Contrasting view: 'No unborn child is unworthy of legal protection' Ann Furedi The widespread opposition, both within Spain and elsewhere in Europe, indicates that the Popular Party's interest in the abortion law is not underwritten by a wider public and political desire to restrict abortion access. Throughout most countries in the developed world, with notable exceptions such as the Republic of Ireland, women's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services, which are often publicly funded. But the Spanish situation provides a shocking reminder of how quickly things can change in a country -- and the extreme consequences this can have for women. Back in 2004, a British newspaper wrongly accused British Pregnancy Advisory Service BPAS of referring women to Spain, when they were "too late" to have an abortion in Britain. The reality was that doctors in Spain were, at that time, legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24-week "time limit" permitted by British law. In the extremely rare cases where women were desperate to access abortion late in pregnancy, they would sometimes find that only a Spanish clinic was able to help them. Crossfire: Abortion exception for rape Texas abortion restrictions overturned Ireland abortion bill vote The Spanish law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations, but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy. Yet barely five years on, Spanish women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation. Will this mean that their need for abortion goes away Of course not. What it means is that Spanish women, like Irish women, will be forced to travel for care to Britain and other European countries. The Irish experience shows with heartbreaking clarity that when a nation makes abortion illegal, it does not prevent women's need for abortion, or their determination to access safe procedures. Outlawing abortion simply sends the issue overseas , increasing the financial and emotional cost to women and, of course, the gestation at which they are able to access a termination. Politicians in the 21st century must accept that abortion is a necessary back-up to contraception, and that it should be a woman's private and personal decision that she is able to make according to what she thinks is best for her and her family. It is a travesty that abortion is included in the criminal statute in so many countries -- including Britain. As a moral matter it should be for a woman to decide in line with her values; she should be allowed to take responsibility for life and choose what she thinks is best. As a medical matter, if should be regulated like any other medical procedure. This point was put very nicely by the London Times in December 2013, in a leading article challenging the new Spanish law. "To bring the criminal law into an issue of women's health and conscientious reflection is an abuse of government power," argued this establishment newspaper . "A constitutional society does not intrude into areas of personal judgment that most citizens consider fall within the authority of the family. Social engineering is the practice of autocratic governments." Spain is heading towards a self-made mess. We know from the situation in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, what the consequences of its new law are likely to be. The lesson for other governments is that they should stay out of women's personal decisions. "Nosotras Decidimos," proclaim the Spanish women's organizations protesting against their inhumane new law -- "We Decide." Throughout Europe, organizations such as BPAS will be standing behind them, and providing the services that these women need. But how much better it would be if they could access this care at home - as, until so recently, they could. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ann Furedi.
