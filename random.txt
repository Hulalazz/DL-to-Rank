<title>U.S. planning possible withdrawal of all troops from Afghanistan - CNN.com</title>
<text>No bluff: U.S. planning possible withdrawal of all troops from Afghanistan By Barbara Starr and Tom Cohen, CNN updated 8:57 PM EST, Tue February 25, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS President Obama calls Afghan leader to discuss security agreement Obama orders planning for bringing home all U.S. troops at the end of 2014 Afghan President Karzai refuses to sign a deal to keep some troops there The White House says an agreement could happen after Karzai leaves office in April Washington CNN -- We're not bluffing, the Obama administration told Afghanistan on Tuesday in announcing for the first time it has started planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of the year if no security agreement is signed. Statements by the White House and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel showed President Barack Obama's impatience with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai's refusal to sign the agreement that would keep several thousand American troops in the country after combat operations conclude this year. In a phone call with Karzai on Tuesday to discuss upcoming elections for a new Afghan leader, Obama made clear that time was running out to properly plan for keeping any U.S. forces in the country beyond 2014, the White House said. Meanwhile, a senior Pakistani official warned that pulling out U.S. troops could have dire consequences, leading to a civil war in Afghanistan. Obama calling "President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014," said the White House statement. Abdullah Abdullah on Afghan future Soldiers return to new and familiar faces Hagel: Cuts reflect 'repositioning' It also noted that a deal remained possible with a new Afghan leader, even if Karzai fails to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement before the April election chooses his successor. History not repeating itself in Afghanistan "Should we have a BSA and a willing and committed partner in the Afghan government, a limited post-2014 mission focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and going after the remnants of core al Qaeda could be in the interests of the United States and Afghanistan," the White House said. "Therefore, we will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year." In his separate statement, Hagel said he strongly supported the order by Obama to "ensure adequate plans are in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014." Speaking at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia Tuesday afternoon, Hagel said the situation in Afghanistan will likely be a top item on the agenda at a NATO ministerial conference in Brussels this week. Obama, he said, has been very clear that the possibility of U.S. troops staying in Afghanistan depends "on whether we have a bilateral security agreement signed by the Afghani government, to assure our rights of our troops and other important elements that are required any time America has troops in another country." Pakistani official: Don't do it A senior Pakistani government official told CNN that a full withdrawal of U.S. troops should not be considered, declaring that "the zero option means civil war in Afghanistan." Speaking on condition of not being identified, the Pakistani official predicted that 30% of Afghan forces would desert if U.S. forces leave the country. For the Pentagon, Obama's order means preparing for all contingencies. "For the first time, the commander in chief has told us to begin planning for a complete withdrawal" from Afghanistan, a senior U.S. official told CNN. While the option to keep troops there remains, the situation has reached a point where the Pentagon has to begin planning for all possibilities, the official added. More than 33,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan as the Obama administration winds down the almost 13-year war that began shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The security agreement negotiated between Afghanistan and the United States would cover a continuing mission after 2014 focused on training Afghan forces and counterterrorism. Pentagon: If freed Afghan prisoners return to fight, they're 'legitimate targets' Afghan presidential contender says he'll sign if elected While Karzai has balked at signing, a leading contender to succeed him told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this month that the agreement should proceed. Presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah said he would sign the deal to keep international forces in Afghanistan, and aid dollars flowing, if elected in April. Abdullah said Afghanistan will need the financial and military support of the international community "for years to come." White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday that that longer it takes for security agreement to get signed, the more difficult it will be to properly plan and carry out a U.S. mission after 2014. Continued delay would result in a smaller and less ambitious mission, Carney said. Asked what happens if no agreement gets signed, he said: "We cannot and will not have U.S. troops on the ground" without a signed deal.</text>

<title>The future of Afghanistan: 4 questions facing Obama and Karzai - CNN.com</title>
<text>The future of Afghanistan: 4 questions facing Obama and Karzai By Ashley Fantz, CNN updated 8:23 PM EST, Fri January 11, 2013 No one can be certain all the Afghan-U.S. agreements will be carried out after Hamid Karzai is out of power, analysts note. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: The two presidents agree to accelerate the military transition The White House has floated the idea of leaving no troops in Afghanistan after 2014 Questions include who will follow Karzai and how much it will cost Polls show a low level of interest in the war among Americans CNN -- More than 11 years after the start of the war in Afghanistan, there is some cause to celebrate and some reason to worry. But more than anything, maybe, there are questions. Those questions were on display Friday as Presidents Barack Obama and Hamid Karzai met in Washington to discuss the future of Afghanistan and the United States' role there. Some celebration is justified. Osama bin Laden is dead. Al Qaeda in Afghanistan is gasping for air. Before the United States invaded in 2001, the Taliban forbade women to even come out of their homes. Now women have more freedom -- more than 2 million girls are going to school. More than 300,000 Afghan children who live in the country are on Facebook. But it's not all good news. Military and civilian deaths continue. Contributing on the military side is the phenomenon dubbed "green-on-blue" or "insider" attacks. Of the more than 2,000 American deaths since the 2001 invasion, an increasing number have come at the hands of the Afghans they trusted and trained. Future of Afghan war being decided It's worse for Afghans. Afghan National Security Forces are victims of a greater number of these insider attacks, a Department of Defense spokesman told CNN Friday. And consider some of the events of 2012: The year began with a video showing Marines urinating on dead Afghans. Published photos showed U.S. troops posing with corpses and U.S. soldiers burned Qurans at Bagram Air Force Base, apparently an act committed out of ignorance that it offended Islam. Protests ensued. Presidents agree to speed transition Then there's U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, accused of rampaging through an Afghan village, murdering 17 Afghan civilians, including women and children. On Friday, the two presidents agreed to accelerate the military transition in Afghanistan. Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions throughout the country starting in spring, instead of midyear as was previously expected. Even though Obama and Karzai agreed on some issues, others remain. Who's in control First, Karzai isn't eligible to run for reelection in 2014. Because the country has a constitution and a working government, it's likely that at least some of the points he and Obama agree to could be carried out when he's out of power. But no one can say for sure, analysts note. So far, who would run for president after Karzai is unclear, though some intriguing names have been bandied around. On the ground, U.S. officials have said anywhere between zero to 9,000 U.S. forces could remain in Afghanistan past 2014. Not only will they perhaps have to operate in the tense green-on-blue environment, U.S. trainers who are teaching Afghan military enlistees how to fight say they are under enormous pressure to meet numbers at the sacrifice of quality, experts say. Gayle Lemmon, an American journalist who has spent years off and on in Afghanistan , most recently in December 2011, said a U.S. contractor who is training Afghan recruits complained to her that he doesn't have to thoroughly do his job. "There has been a huge amount of pressure to put as many bodies in Afghani uniform as possible to meet 2013 deadlines," she said. "He thought he had OK people but he didn't have time to pick out who was best and train the ones who needed extra help." The "overwhelming majority" of them are coming from "ordinary Afghans signing up for the military," experienced war correspondent Dexter Filkins has reported . What's the tab This week, Karzai gave the Pentagon a wish list of hardware such as drones and helicopters that he said would help him continue to fight terrorists. No dollar amount has been decided. Estimates range from $1 billion to $10 billion a year -- and that includes military expenses, hardware and training, the whole deal that Afghanistan couldn't afford on its own. "These are really funny numbers because no one knows the extent of what the U.S. is willing to offer," Lemmon notes. Whatever amount Obama administration floats will have to win approval from Congress. Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ronald Neumann told CNN Friday that he thinks the total bill is going to depend on military presence. At a minimum, he figures, the United States will spend $5 billion in aid and military, not counting what would be spent for embassy costs. Those numbers cannot be calculated in a vacuum, either. As a discussion at the Brookings Institute involving the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan noted, Afghanistan is facing a major economic downturn after 2014. A lot of money that has gone into Afghanistan has been wasted , numerous reports have shown. In 2011, one nonpartisan group told Congress that the United States was wasting $12 million a day among contracts issued to support American efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, CNN reported . Even Karzai, prompted by a question from a reporter, said Friday "We have corruption." Opinion: Abandon Afghanistan A dumb idea Who is the U.S. talking with and why Last May, Obama made a surprise visit to Afghanistan, where he gave a speech about the end of the war. He said, "We're pursuing a negotiated peace" with the Taliban. To be clear, al Qaeda and the Taliban are two different entities, though there are ties. Al Qaeda is a terrorist group created by Osama bin Laden. The Taliban has provided shelter and support to al Qaeda. In its newest incarnation, the Taliban has new, and some younger-generation, members who say they want to find peace with the United States. In short, this is a complicated topic, as Foreign Policy detailed in December . Former Ambassador Neumann said it's wrong to call it a negotiation. Instead, he said, it's "a group of multiple players we are only talking to. We are trying to see if there's negotiating room." On the Afghan side, a November poll by the independent San Francisco-based group Asia Foundation found that more than half of Afghans felt that their country was moving in the right direction. That includes agreeing with the negotiation of government officials and those trying to work toward peace to talk with and find common ground with militants. Will the U.S. public stay interested There were complaints during the U.S. presidential election that Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney did not talk enough about Afghanistan. But polls have shown that most Americans are tired of the war. A CNN/ORC International poll in September showed that only 3% named Afghanistan as one of the most important issues facing the United States. Earlier in 2012, CNN polling indicated that only 25% of Americans favored the war, and 55% said the United States should remove all of its troops before 2014. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta pushed back against that figure at the time, saying polls don't fight wars. And this week he reiterated his opposition to taking the number of troops in Afghanistan down to a paltry sum, and said zero is out of the question for him. If the United States military doesn't have a strong presence there, the chances of talking -- or negotiating -- with the Taliban is diminished, he argued. Neumann said he thinks the American public is disinterested in a war that has dragged on for so many years. That's a hurtful thing to hear for military families who have endured so much. Rebekah Sanderlin , a journalist and longtime military culture blogger, is disheartened by such talk. Her husband has done multiple tours in Afghanistan and is preparing to go back. "It's offensive to me to hear that from people who haven't had skin in the game , that they are weary," she said. "We still have troops fighting, sacrificing time with their families. All of that is much harder when you don't feel like your country is behind you."</text>

<title>Official: Talks between U.S., Taliban on Afghan war expected soon - CNN.com</title>
<text>Talks between U.S., Taliban on Afghan war expected 'in the next few days' By Jill Dougherty. Chelsea J. Carter and Masoud Popalzai, CNN updated 12:15 PM EDT, Thu June 20, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Prisoner exchanges will be on the agenda NEW: The U.S. wants Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl to be released, official says NEW: U.S., Afghan governments in "close coordination," State Department official says NEW: Obama: Afghan President Hamid Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation Kabul, Afghanistan CNN -- Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban over the war in Afghanistan will probably be held "in the next few days," a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not offer up a time line for the discussions. But a prisoner exchange is one of the issues the United States intends to discuss with the Taliban. Senior U.S. officials say they want the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier captured by militants in 2009. "We have every reason to believe" Bowe Bergdahl is alive, a Pentagon official told CNN. News that the meeting was moving forward followed a tumultuous day that saw questions raised about the peace process after an angry Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was pulling out of the peace talks with the Taliban and canceling security talks with the United States. Security handed over to Afghan forces Inside a firefight with the Taliban Uncertainty marks Afghan handover Karzai was angered about reports that the Taliban appeared to be offering their new office in Doha, Qatar, up as an alternative government, going so far as to put up a sign proclaiming it the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the name the Taliban used during their rule. In a statement released by Karzai's office, the president said "foreign powers" were behind Tuesday's opening of the Taliban office. Taliban talks announced as Afghanistan assumes security Karzai appeared to renew earlier claims that the Taliban and Western officials want to destabilize Afghanistan. Despite Karzai's decisions to pull back, the United States continues "close coordination" with the Afghan government on peace and security talks, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jenn Psaki said Wednesday. Karzai's office said Taliban rhetoric about continuing to take the fight to Afghan and foreign fighters, even as the group pursues a political solution, was "completely in contradiction to the assurance that was given to Afghanistan by the United States of America." He used similar justification for suspending security negotiations with the United States over the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan past the scheduled pullout next year. In March, Karzai appeared to accuse the United States and the Taliban of collusion, saying violent attacks by the group "show that the Taliban are serving the foreigners and are not against them." He later walked the remarks back, saying they were misinterpreted. Speaking Wednesday in Berlin, U.S. President Barack Obama said he wasn't surprised by Karzai's response. "We had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground," Obama said. But he said that he believes Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation, and that he needs to be. "We don't expect that it will be easy," Obama told reporters at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. "But we do think ultimately we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country." At their office in Doha, Taliban make changes Conflicting Taliban messages The Taliban opened the Doha office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks. But a Taliban spokesman also said the group would continue its military campaign, a promise soon followed by the group's claim of responsibility for the death of four U.S. troops. Psaki said that the name of the Taliban office came as a surprise to U.S. officials and that Qatari officials took the name off the office door Wednesday, replacing it with the more neutral "Political Office of the Afghan Taliban." Karzai's office said Wednesday that his administration wants peace with the Taliban. 4 Americans killed at U.S. base in Afghanistan; Taliban claim responsibility "But the messages of continuation of fighting which were sent out during the opening of the Taliban office in Qatar are completely in contradiction with the peace-wanting spirit of the government of Afghanistan," Karzai said. He said the High Peace Council would not take part in the talks with the Taliban in Doha "until the process is completely left to Afghans." Karzai earlier Wednesday suspended talks with the United States over maintaining a troop presence in Afghanistan to help train Afghan forces past the scheduled 2014 pullout date for Western troops. The agreement could provide the basis for any future NATO role in Afghanistan. Karzai's decision to suspend those talks came a day after NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces. The Afghan government suspended the talks "in view of the contradiction between acts and the statements made by the United States of America in regard to the Peace Process," it said in a statement. Why is U.S. now brokering peace with Taliban Hopes revived for captured soldier Bergdahl was captured after he finished his guard shift at a combat outpost in Afghanistan's Paktika province, in the southeastern section of the county. Since his capture, four videos of the Idaho native have been released. The last video was sent in February 2011, and it's unclear where Bergdahl is being held now. He was a private at the time. The army has been giving him promotions that would have come to him had his Army career gone as planned. If he returns home safely, the Army will give him all the back pay that he has earned while in captivity. The military told CNN it had no reason to believe Bergdahl was dead. Bergdahl's family received a letter from the captive soldier recently. His father mentioned receiving the letter in an e-mail exchange with Dwight Murphy, the spokesman for the local POW/MIA group in Boise Valley, Idaho. "We have received a letter from Bowe through the Red Cross!" the father says in the exchange. "He was scripted and redacted but he was no doubt alive and his faculties fully functioning as of two months ago." He did not say when he got the letter, but Murphy copied and pasted the exchange with the father on his Facebook page after receiving his permission to do so. The father's letter goes on say, "They are being very careful with him. He is still highly valued at high levels. "Guantanamo, drones and politics in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Washington are still the big issues." His father has rarely spoken to the media. In his exchange with Murphy, he said he believed "we are getting closer to a resolution." But, he added, there seems to be a disagreement among the Taliban about the direction forward. "It appears at least several parties want to arbitrate captive SGT Bowe, several others ... want to keep fighting until every single Westerner is out," the father said.

<sentence cont=0 >Carter and Masoud Popalzai, CNN updated 12:15 PM EDT, Thu June 20, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Prisoner exchanges will be on the agenda NEW: The U.S. wants Sgt.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Bowe Bergdahl to be released, official says NEW: U.S., Afghan governments in "close coordination," State Department official says NEW: Obama: Afghan President Hamid Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation Kabul, Afghanistan CNN -- Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban over the war in Afghanistan will probably be held "in the next few days," a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Wednesday.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not offer up a time line for the discussions.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >But a prisoner exchange is one of the issues the United States intends to discuss with the Taliban.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Senior U.S. officials say they want the release of Sgt.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Bowe Bergdahl, a soldier captured by militants in 2009.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We have every reason to believe" Bowe Bergdahl is alive, a Pentagon official told CNN.</sentence>
<sentence cont= >News that the meeting was moving forward followed a tumultuous day that saw questions raised about the peace process after an angry Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he was pulling out of the peace talks with the Taliban and canceling security talks with the United States.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Security handed over to Afghan forces Inside a firefight with the Taliban Uncertainty marks Afghan handover Karzai was angered about reports that the Taliban appeared to be offering their new office in Doha, Qatar, up as an alternative government, going so far as to put up a sign proclaiming it the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan -- the name the Taliban used during their rule.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >In a statement released by Karzai's office, the president said "foreign powers" were behind Tuesday's opening of the Taliban office.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Taliban talks announced as Afghanistan assumes security Karzai appeared to renew earlier claims that the Taliban and Western officials want to destabilize Afghanistan.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Despite Karzai's decisions to pull back, the United States continues "close coordination" with the Afghan government on peace and security talks, U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >State Department spokeswoman Jenn Psaki said Wednesday.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Karzai's office said Taliban rhetoric about continuing to take the fight to Afghan and foreign fighters, even as the group pursues a political solution, was "completely in contradiction to the assurance that was given to Afghanistan by the United States of America." He used similar justification for suspending security negotiations with the United States over the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan past the scheduled pullout next year.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >In March, Karzai appeared to accuse the United States and the Taliban of collusion, saying violent attacks by the group "show that the Taliban are serving the foreigners and are not against them." He later walked the remarks back, saying they were misinterpreted.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Speaking Wednesday in Berlin, U.S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >President Barack Obama said he wasn't surprised by Karzai's response.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We had anticipated that at the outset there were going to be some areas of friction, to put it mildly, in getting this thing off the ground," Obama said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >But he said that he believes Karzai remains committed to political reconciliation, and that he needs to be.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"We don't expect that it will be easy," Obama told reporters at a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"But we do think ultimately we're going to need to see Afghans talking to Afghans about how they can move forward and end the cycle of violence so they can start actually building their country." At their office in Doha, Taliban make changes Conflicting Taliban messages The Taliban opened the Doha office with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >But a Taliban spokesman also said the group would continue its military campaign, a promise soon followed by the group's claim of responsibility for the death of four U.S. troops.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Psaki said that the name of the Taliban office came as a surprise to U.S. officials and that Qatari officials took the name off the office door Wednesday, replacing it with the more neutral "Political Office of the Afghan Taliban." Karzai's office said Wednesday that his administration wants peace with the Taliban.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >4 Americans killed at U.S. base in Afghanistan; Taliban claim responsibility "But the messages of continuation of fighting which were sent out during the opening of the Taliban office in Qatar are completely in contradiction with the peace-wanting spirit of the government of Afghanistan," Karzai said.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >He said the High Peace Council would not take part in the talks with the Taliban in Doha "until the process is completely left to Afghans." Karzai earlier Wednesday suspended talks with the United States over maintaining a troop presence in Afghanistan to help train Afghan forces past the scheduled 2014 pullout date for Western troops.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The agreement could provide the basis for any future NATO role in Afghanistan.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Karzai's decision to suspend those talks came a day after NATO-led troops transferred security responsibility to Afghan forces.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The Afghan government suspended the talks "in view of the contradiction between acts and the statements made by the United States of America in regard to the Peace Process," it said in a statement.</sentence>

<title>U.S., Afghanistan reach security agreement - CNN.com</title>
<text>U.S., Afghanistan reach security pact through '2024 and beyond' By Greg Botelho, CNN updated 8:36 PM EST, Wed November 20, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: John Kerry says "it's up to the people of Afghanistan" to approve the agreement If they do, the deal would extend from 2015 through 2024 "and beyond" It says U.S. "forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan" CNN -- The United States and Afghanistan have reached a deal on the final language of a bilateral security agreement, guiding the role of American troops in that south Asian nation for years to come, America's top diplomat said Wednesday. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the accord was reached during conversations Wednesday between himself and Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Afghan leaders will hold a meeting -- known as a loya jirga, or grand assembly -- starting on Thursday to decide whether to accept or reject the deal, which lays out a limited support role for American forces beyond next year. "They have to pass it," Kerry said. "... It's up to the people of Afghanistan." If approved, the agreement would go into effect January 1, 2015, and last "until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless terminated" by mutual agreement and with two years notice by either party, according to a copy of the deal posted online Wednesday by the Afghan government that a U.S. official confirms is authentic. Rice: No U.S. apology to Afghanistan Rice: Reports of a U.S. apology to Afghanistan are false The subject of military raids and strikes has long been a sore point between the two countries, especially given a number of incidents in which noncombatant men, women and children were killed. The proposed deal contains references to respecting "Afghanistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity," and adds U.S. forces "shall not target Afghan civilians, including in their homes." But this agreement does not address past transgressions. In fact, Kerry strongly rejected a U.S. apology for operations that resulted in civilian casualties was part of the back-and-forth, as some published reports suggested, insisting "it's just not even on the table." "I don't know where the idea of an apology started," Kerry said. "President Karzai didn't ask for an apology. ... There has never been a discussion of or the word apology used in our discussions whatsoever." The agreement does state that U.S. forces will play a support role in Afghanistan, while at the same time ceding that "U.S. military operations to defeat al Qaeda and its affiliates may be appropriate in the common fight against terrorism." "U.S. military counterterrorism operations are intended to complement and support the Afghan military's counterterrorism operations, with the goal of maintaining the Afghan military's lead and with full respect for Afghan sovereignty and full regard for the safety and security of the Afghan people, including in their homes," the tentative deal states. Mine blast kills seven -- and they were all children The agreement also includes language on the U.S. government's continued funding for Afghan security forces, funneling such contributions through the Kabul-based government. The U.S. military "shall have the exclusive right" to discipline and prosecute its members for alleged acts committed on Afghan soil, according to the tentative deal, though Afghan authorities can ask that anyone be taken out of the country. U.S. troops first deployed to Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the south Asian nation. Since taking office, President Barack Obama has promised -- and, in some cases, acted -- to reduce troop levels there, in addition to stating the goal of ending the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014. The approval of a security agreement would pave the way for Americans troops to remain on the ground in Afghanistan beyond that. Speaking on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney stressed that any U.S. forces would have "a very limited mission" and would not be "patrolling cities or mountains." "The war in Afghanistan will end next year, as the president has promised," Carney said. "The combat mission will be over." Kerry used similar language in calling the U.S. military's role in Afghanistan "very limited," adding "it is entirely to train, equip and assist" Afghan forces. The language in the proposed security agreement, in fact, speaks to that point: "Unless otherwise mutually agreed, the United States forces shall not conduct combat operations in Afghanistan."</text>

<title>The psychological toll of war - CNN.com</title>
<text>The psychological toll of war By Eric Zillmer, Special to CNN updated 8:43 AM EDT, Tue March 13, 2012 U.S. soldiers keeping watch at the entrance of a military base near Alkozai in Panjwayi District, Kandahar Province, on March 11. STORY HIGHLIGHTS An American soldier allegedly went on a rampage and killed 16 Afghan civilians Eric Zillmer: Has psychological impact of Afghanistan war been underestimated He says the soldier's horrific act cannot be attributed solely to traumatic brain injury Zillmer: Our military must do more to prepare troops for challenges in combat zones Editor's note: Eric Zillmer is the Carl R. Pacifico professor of neuropsychology and director of athletics at Drexel University. He is the co-author of "Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Application" Guilford Press. CNN -- What motivated an American soldier to allegedly open fire and kill 16 innocent Afghan civilians in cold blood No one knows at this point. The soldier, an Army staff sergeant, seems to have acted alone, and he turned himself in to authorities after the shooting rampage. What we do know is that he had been injured in an accident while deployed to Iraq in 2010. Despite being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, he was found fit for duty. It's common for the military to evaluate service members for fitness for duty. The most important question asked is: Can the soldier safely and effectively perform his job from a mental health or neuropsychological standpoint More than a million individuals suffer a traumatic brain injury each year in the United States. Many of these people have experienced problems processing complex information. However, the execution-style killing of innocent people is not something that people with a traumatic brain injury would carry out. So while it's possible that "brain damage" is a contributing factor, it is unlikely to explain the slayings. Eric Zillmer One convenient answer would be that he is a "bad apple," he simply went temporarily insane. If that were the case, then no military leader or peer could have predicted the rampage. He is a rogue soldier who can plead insanity in the court of justice. The blame falls solely on him. However, one can't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events, including the desecration of Taliban corpses by four Marines, the burning of the Quran by U.S. troops, and now, the slaying of Afghan civilians, point to the toll that the Afghanistan war is taking. Has the psychological impact of the long war been underestimated Afghanistan, by any standard, is a tough terrain with complex politics and even more complex culture. The mental, emotional and physical burden on our troops is formidable. Most of Afghanistan's population is uneducated and illiterate, and held in terror by the Taliban, who operate through threats, corruption, extortion, blackmail and intimidation. Our troops must not only deal with the daily risks of attacks from the Taliban, but also mistrust, unease or hostility from the Afghans. While U.S. forces attempt to interact as much as possible with locals, the fact remains that they are foreigners who are mostly stationed on temporary bases, located far away from community centers and operate mostly on mission-based initiatives. War, of course, is always stressful. History has many examples. And the war in Afghanistan is no exception. During the American Civil War, the stress associated with going to war was known as homesickness. During WWI, it was shell shock. After WWII, it was battle fatigue. During the Gulf War, a new term was coined -- Combat Stress Reaction. Combat stress is now thought to be a normal reaction to the abnormal events encountered during war, including different rules of engagement, morale ups and downs, fatigue, sensory overload or extreme weather. Anger toward the civilian community is also considered a symptom. The U.S. military is not naïve to combat stress. Much effort has been made to prepare troops for the symptoms of combat stress before deployment. Once troops are deployed, they can be provided immediate assistance if problems arise and help is nearby. Our military has been a technological leader in building better armored vehicles, using superior aerial surveillance via remotely operated drones and employing ever better laser-guided missiles. But the Pentagon should also emphasize an important nontechnological component in its military training: the need to include a better understanding of the crosscultural challenges that are likely to be encountered when troops are deployed into foreign combat zones like Afghanistan. As we learn more about the 38-year-old married staff sergeant who is a qualified infantry sniper and serving his third deployment in the Middle East, we have already learned one very painful lesson. Namely, there is an expensive psychological cost to sending our men and women to war. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion</text>

<title>McCain: Why we can -- and must -- win the war in Afghanistan - CNN.com</title>
<text>Stanley McChrystal Editor's note: John McCain is the senior U.S. Senator from Arizona. WASHINGTON CNN -- For the first time since September 11, 2001, America is having a vigorous national debate about how to succeed in Afghanistan. This debate is entirely worth having. Whenever America sends its citizens into harm's way, it must do so with eyes wide open. Though no veteran would ever think of himself as "pro-war," I believe that the fight in Afghanistan is critical to our national security. Our goals there are achievable and success is worth the continued sacrifice. We must succeed in Afghanistan for many reasons, but one stands above all: the world walked away from Afghanistan once, and it descended into a cauldron of violence, hatred and human rights atrocities that served as the base for the worst terrorist attack in history against our homeland. We cannot let that happen again, and we cannot let the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies conquer Afghanistan once more. Failure of this kind would also destabilize the entire strategically vital region, including nuclear-armed Pakistan. We know what it takes to succeed in Afghanistan: a resolute commitment to the principles of counterinsurgency, which turned Iraq around during the surge. I am confident that properly resourced counterinsurgency policy, adapted to the unique culture and geography of Afghanistan, can lead to success there. Our entire military chain of command supports this approach, as do our NATO allies, which they made clear at their recent defense ministerial meeting in Bratislava. I supported President Obama when he called for a counterinsurgency plan in March, and I did so again when he deployed Gen. Stanley McChrystal to lead the command in Kabul. I agree with our commander's assessment of the security situation as "deteriorating" and that our civilian and military leaders urgently need more resources, including more combat troops, to turn the tide toward success. I sympathize with our president, because sending men and women into harm's way is the most difficult decision that a commander-in-chief must make. However, Americans are already serving in harm's way in Afghanistan, and the sooner we can provide the reinforcements and resources they need, the safer and more successful they will be. So I am urging President Obama to move as quickly as possible to fully support Gen. McChrystal's request for more troops. It is true that the Afghan government is not as strong or credible as we would like, but that should not deter us from committing more civilian and military resources now. Local governments in counterinsurgency environments are usually weak and fledgling. There is an insurgency in the first place because it seeks to exploit the local population's dissatisfaction with its government. As long as Afghanistan is insecure, it is unreasonable to assume that governance will improve. That is why protecting the population must be job one right now, and in the immediate term, much of that work must be done by U.S. and NATO troops. As security improves, however, we will be able to train capable, battle-tested Afghan security forces that can defend their country. We can break the insurgency's momentum, enabling Afghans to reconcile with former fighters who are willing to lay down their arms. And we can create an environment of safety in which it is more realistic to expect Afghan leaders to meet the high standards of their fellow citizens and their international partners -- namely, the provision of justice and opportunity, the protection of human rights and a crackdown on corruption. Ultimately, Afghans will judge the legitimacy of their government not only by the result of one round of voting, but by its performance in delivering basic services. Success in Afghanistan will emerge, as it did in Iraq, when local leaders and citizens are more and more able to take responsibility for governing and securing their own sovereign country without substantial international assistance. This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future. That is our goal, and we must stay in the fight until it is won. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John McCain. Share this on:</text>

<sentence cont=1 >WASHINGTON CNN -- For the first time since September 11, 2001, America is having a vigorous national debate about how to succeed in Afghanistan.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >This debate is entirely worth having.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Whenever America sends its citizens into harm's way, it must do so with eyes wide open.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Though no veteran would ever think of himself as "pro-war," I believe that the fight in Afghanistan is critical to our national security.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Our goals there are achievable and success is worth the continued sacrifice.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >We must succeed in Afghanistan for many reasons, but one stands above all: the world walked away from Afghanistan once, and it descended into a cauldron of violence, hatred and human rights atrocities that served as the base for the worst terrorist attack in history against our homeland.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >We cannot let that happen again, and we cannot let the Taliban and its al Qaeda allies conquer Afghanistan once more.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Failure of this kind would also destabilize the entire strategically vital region, including nuclear-armed Pakistan.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >We know what it takes to succeed in Afghanistan: a resolute commitment to the principles of counterinsurgency, which turned Iraq around during the surge.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >I am confident that properly resourced counterinsurgency policy, adapted to the unique culture and geography of Afghanistan, can lead to success there.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Our entire military chain of command supports this approach, as do our NATO allies, which they made clear at their recent defense ministerial meeting in Bratislava.</sentence>

<sentence cont=1 >I agree with our commander's assessment of the security situation as "deteriorating" and that our civilian and military leaders urgently need more resources, including more combat troops, to turn the tide toward success.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >I sympathize with our president, because sending men and women into harm's way is the most difficult decision that a commander-in-chief must make.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >However, Americans are already serving in harm's way in Afghanistan, and the sooner we can provide the reinforcements and resources they need, the safer and more successful they will be.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >So I am urging President Obama to move as quickly as possible to fully support Gen.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >McChrystal's request for more troops.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >It is true that the Afghan government is not as strong or credible as we would like, but that should not deter us from committing more civilian and military resources now.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Local governments in counterinsurgency environments are usually weak and fledgling.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >There is an insurgency in the first place because it seeks to exploit the local population's dissatisfaction with its government.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >As long as Afghanistan is insecure, it is unreasonable to assume that governance will improve.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >That is why protecting the population must be job one right now, and in the immediate term, much of that work must be done by U.S. and NATO troops.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >As security improves, however, we will be able to train capable, battle-tested Afghan security forces that can defend their country.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >We can break the insurgency's momentum, enabling Afghans to reconcile with former fighters who are willing to lay down their arms.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >And we can create an environment of safety in which it is more realistic to expect Afghan leaders to meet the high standards of their fellow citizens and their international partners -- namely, the provision of justice and opportunity, the protection of human rights and a crackdown on corruption.</sentence>

<title>Time for U.S. to ban use of torture (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>Time for U.S. to ban use of torture By Donald P. Gregg updated 9:15 AM EDT, Tue September 16, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS U.S. can no longer assert that we do not torture our enemies, argues Donald Gregg CIA should make public any evaluations it might have about effectiveness of torture, Gregg says Gregg: Use of torture by U.S. puts captured Americans in even greater danger Editor's note: Donald P. Gregg, a former ambassador to South Korea, is author of the new memoir "Pot Shards: Fragments of a Life Lived in CIA, the White House, and the Two Koreas." The views expressed are his own alone. CNN -- I worked as a CIA operations officer and station chief during the Cold War years. In the gray world of espionage, there was a clear distinction, at least in my mind, between the CIA and our opponents: They tortured their prisoners, we did not. The CIA's main opponent was the Soviet Union's KGB, whose headquarters on Lubyanka Square in Moscow was notorious for torture. In those days, I believed that the greatest thing going for me as an intelligence officer was the fact that I was an American. Donald Gregg Now, as the Senate Intelligence Committee prepares to make public some of the findings of its investigation into CIA torture after 9/11, let's hope we can start a much needed public reckoning over a tragic mistake that has undermined the very principles I and many others felt we stood for. Our resorting to torture after 9/11 has cost us dearly -- we can no longer assert that we do not torture our enemies, leaving us in a much weaker position when urging our allies or our opponents to eschew such tactics. Now any American, civilian or military, who falls into the hands of our fundamentalist enemies is in even greater danger of being tortured or killed. Amnesty: Torture is flourishing Vote to declassify CIA torture report Advocates of allowing for the use of torture or what they prefer to describe as enhanced interrogation techniques assert that since we haven't suffered a major attack since 9/11, that torture must somehow have played a part in preventing one. Even President Barack Obama, in his admission that unnamed officials "tortured some folks" in extremely dangerous times after 9/11, seemed only apologetic, not outraged. Indeed, he appeared to urge understanding for the torturers' failings. Meanwhile, there is profound reluctance on the part of CIA to reveal its own evaluation of the efficacy of its use of torture, as this might risk disclosing the torturers' identities -- and those of the people who put them to work. The CIA's extraordinary admission that it has essentially spied on the Senate Intelligence Committee by hacking into computers of committee staff members is merely another stark example of its reluctance to come completely clean about what it has been doing. View my Flipboard Magazine. It is difficult not to conclude that such reluctance is largely based on the fact that very little of value was learned -- in line with what is reported to be the conclusion of the Intelligence Committee. This is all the more frustrating because during my tours in wartime Vietnam in the early 1970s, and as station chief in Seoul, South Korea, I worked hard and effectively against the use of torture. But it would be almost impossible for me to take such positions today. So what do we do now In addition to public release of the Intelligence Committee report, the CIA should be compelled to make public, with the fewest possible redactions, its detailed internal evaluation of what, if anything, torture achieved, what it failed to do and what its use has cost us. Based on an examination of that report, and with input from experts in the field, a new Executive Order should be crafted and considered that bans torture by any U.S. governmental organization, while also naming techniques, such as water boarding, that are specifically forbidden. The basic issue is this: Are we a country that stands by its traditional standards and values through thick or thin, or are we a country that says "We cannot cope with this situation, so let's turn to torture" For those who assert that America is weaker than it once was, I would say in response that our lapse into the use of torture simply lends credence to such accusations. Of course, accountability can be a bitter pill to swallow. But if we are to move away from this debilitating tendency to resort to torture when the road ahead looks tough, then accountability must start with those that have brought us to where we are today -- it is essential that they face up to the consequences and costs of their decisions. Maybe then America can lead by example on an issue where we have needlessly sacrificed the high ground.</text>

<title>Rights group accuses Nigerian police of torture - CNN.com</title>
<text>Rights group accuses Nigerian police of torture By Laura Smith-Spark, CNN updated 3:39 PM EDT, Fri September 19, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Amnesty International alleges the systemic use of torture by the police in Nigeria Methods used include nail or tooth extractions, choking, electric shocks and rape, it says A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force refutes the claim, cites "blatant falsehoods" "Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police," he says Editor's note: This article includes graphic descriptions of violence. CNN -- Nigerian security forces routinely torture people -- including women and children -- taken in as suspects or for interrogation, Amnesty International has claimed in a graphic new report . In the study, released Thursday, the rights group alleges systemic use of torture by the police, based on hundreds of witness testimonies and other evidence gathered over the course of 10 years. People are often detained in dragnet operations and tortured as punishment, to extort money or to extract "confessions" as a shortcut to "solve" cases, it claims. The report, titled " 'Welcome to hell fire': Torture and other ill-treatment in Nigeria" alleges that abuse is so widespread that many police stations have an informal "officer in charge of torture" and that some police sections have special rooms, or "torture chambers" where it is carried out. Methods commonly used include nail or tooth extractions, choking, electric shocks, rape and other sexual violence, it claims. A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force refuted the allegations, however, saying the report contained "some blatant falsehoods and innuendos." "Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police," said Emmanuel Ojukwu, force public relations officer and acting commissioner of police, in a statement. Amnesty says its researchers interviewed victims, their families, rights defenders and current and former police officers to compile the report. Boko Haram crackdown The number of reported abuses has increased in northern Nigeria as Nigeria's security forces have stepped up their fight against Boko Haram , the report said. Since 2009, between 5,000 and 10,000 people have been detained as suspects in the crackdown on the militant Islamist group, which is designated as a terror organization by the United States. One man, identified only as Ahmed, said he was among a group of men who were stopped by soldiers outside a mosque after prayers in Yobe state in February 2013. He said the soldiers "told all of us to lie down on the ground in the street." "The soldiers shot and killed some of them on the spot, some were shot on the legs, and the soldiers began to beat some of us on the head with iron rods, others were beaten with wood." The men were taken by vehicles to prison, Ahmed said, and some of the wounded men died on the way. Once there, they were "kept tied for three days," fed only "handfuls" of food per day, and forced to share a half-liter of water per two men per day. The report goes on to quote Ahmed: The beating, the torture was just too much for us. They do all types of things to you, the soldiers. They will tie your hands behind your back, with the elbows touching and then one of them will walk on your tied hands with their boots. Your hands will remain tied and then they'll pour salt water on your wounds. You can't rub it, even if it goes into your eyes. My eyes got swollen as a result of that. I thought I was going to be blind. I have never experienced such brutality in my life." 'I was bleeding' "This goes far beyond the appalling torture and killing of suspected Boko Haram members," said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International's research and advocacy director for Africa. "Across the country, the scope and severity of torture inflicted on Nigeria's women, men and children by the authorities supposed to protect them is shocking to even the most hardened human rights observer." Belay called for Nigeria's Parliament to take the "long overdue step" of passing a law to criminalize torture, which is banned under the country's constitution and international treaties. The report also cited examples of abuse against women and children. Mahmood, a 15-year-old boy from Yobe state in northern Nigeria, "was arrested by soldiers with around 50 other people, mainly boys between 13 and 19 years old," the report stated. Amnesty International said the military "held him for three weeks, beat him repeatedly with their gun butts, batons and machetes, poured melting plastic on his back, made him walk and roll over broken bottles and forced him to watch other detainees being executed without trial. Mahmood was freed in April 2013, according to the report. Military in Yobe state even arrested and beat a 12-year-old boy, poured alcohol on him, forced him to clean vomit with his bare hands and stepped on him. One 24-year-old woman named Abosede told Amnesty International she was abused using tear gas and still suffers as a result. "A policewoman took me to a small room, told me to remove everything I was wearing," she is quoted as saying. "She spread my legs wide and fired tear gas into my vagina... I was asked to confess that I was an armed robber... I was bleeding... up till now I still feel pain in my womb." 'Not systemic or endemic' Ojukwu said the Nigerian Police Force has been "undergoing systematic reforms, and aligning themselves with the demands of democracy" but that it has significantly improved its human rights record since 1999. "The police do not routinely torture suspects," he said. "It is not systemic or endemic. Whenever instances of human rights abuses are brought to the notice of superintending officers, the offending personnel are promptly sanctioned in line with the laws and regulations." The Amnesty International reporters did not speak to the police authorities, he said, which denied them the opportunity to have a fair hearing. He called on Amnesty International to provide specific details of the allegations and said they would be investigated. Belay dismissed the Nigerian police response to the Amnesty International report. "The police decision to deny the findings before careful reading of the report or examining the accusations made in it echoes their attitude to criminal investigations -- apportioning blame before ascertaining the facts. "Their pledge to investigate abuses rings hollow so long as they continue to refute our evidence of systemic torture, gathered from more than 500 cases and including testimony from current and former police officers." CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.</text>

<title>Opinion: Take the CIA out of the loop on torture report - CNN.com</title>
<text>Take CIA out of loop on torture report By Christopher Anders updated 3:35 PM EDT, Thu April 3, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Christopher Anders worries that CIA is trying to slip one past Senate and American people A controversial report on torture should be declassified, he argues On Thursday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved release of the report Anders says President Obama needs to rein in the troubled agency Editor's note: Christopher Anders is senior legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me three times Good grief, no one should ever be fooled three times. But that's exactly what will happen to the Senate Intelligence Committee -- and the American people -- unless President Barack Obama puts a leash on an unchecked CIA. He now must stop it from taking any more steps to try to hide its record of torture, secret prisons and the kidnapping program known as extraordinary rendition. Christopher Anders Under the leadership of Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee conducted a five-year investigation into the CIA's use of torture between 2001 and 2006. Senators and their staff members reviewed more than 3 million pages of CIA documents, resulting in a report of more than 6,000 pages. The committee voted Thursday to submit its report on torture to the executive branch for a declassification review and then public release. One of the very few conclusions of the report that will be made public is that the CIA repeatedly misled Congress, the White House and the Justice Department on the facts of the torture program. An entire section of the report is dedicated to CIA falsehoods, presumably including lies to the very committee charged with overseeing the CIA. Fool the Senate once, shame on the CIA. After nearly four years of investigating, the committee voted in December 2012 to adopt the report but delayed any vote on declassifying it until the CIA -- the agency that the committee had just concluded had lied to Congress and carried out all of the illegal conduct in the report -- had 60 days to review the report. CIA and Senate at war over torture Rand Paul: We must watch the watchers Feinstein: I have asked for an apology Well, 60 days turned into more than six months as the CIA reportedly found almost no factual errors in the report but nonetheless wrote a couple hundred pages reportedly asserting the efficacy of the program and attacking the report's methodology. The agency, however, wasn't done. It then ran a whisper campaign among reporters to disparage the Senate report. The CIA campaign to hide the truth didn't just stop with foot dragging or writing counter-reports. It reportedly went as far as spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee staff's use of computers dedicated for their exclusive use. Feinstein has characterized the reported incidents as possibly violating the constitutional separation of powers principle, the Fourth Amendment, a criminal computer fraud statute and an executive order banning the CIA from spying domestically. The CIA must be held responsible for any laws broken, but it is certainly reasonable to ask why the Senate Intelligence Committee or the White House ever let the agency get its controlling hands on the report in the first place. Fool the Senate twice, shame on the Senate. With the committee poised to vote to submit the torture report for a declassification review and then public release, it is worth asking: Will the Senate risk getting fooled by the CIA a third time CIA Director John Brennan has promised to play nice, saying that if sent the Senate torture report yet again, the CIA would "carry out the review expeditiously." Yes, let's again entrust the report to the agency that broke the law on torture and was so brazen that until this month, its acting CIA general counsel was a lawyer named 1,600 times in the torture report. Only a fool would be fooled three times. Feinstein should insist -- and Obama should agree -- that the White House itself conduct the declassification review. Furthermore, only White House officials who had no role in any of the banned practices described in the report should be involved in the review, and the CIA should be consulted only as needed -- with only CIA officials untainted by torture looped in. By law, the president has authority to declassify information, and he surely has the authority to decide the process for declassifying this landmark report. The CIA should never have had a torture program, never should have lied about what it was doing and never should have been given broad authority to review the Senate oversight report. Obama cannot now hand the agency a black-out pen to continue to hide the horrors it inflicted around the globe and the harm it caused to our American values.

<sentence cont=1 >Fool me twice, shame on me.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Fool me three times Good grief, no one should ever be fooled three times.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >But that's exactly what will happen to the Senate Intelligence Committee -- and the American people -- unless President Barack Obama puts a leash on an unchecked CIA.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >He now must stop it from taking any more steps to try to hide its record of torture, secret prisons and the kidnapping program known as extraordinary rendition.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Christopher Anders Under the leadership of Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the committee conducted a five-year investigation into the CIA's use of torture between 2001 and 2006.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Senators and their staff members reviewed more than 3 million pages of CIA documents, resulting in a report of more than 6,000 pages.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The committee voted Thursday to submit its report on torture to the executive branch for a declassification review and then public release.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >One of the very few conclusions of the report that will be made public is that the CIA repeatedly misled Congress, the White House and the Justice Department on the facts of the torture program.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >An entire section of the report is dedicated to CIA falsehoods, presumably including lies to the very committee charged with overseeing the CIA.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Fool the Senate once, shame on the CIA.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >After nearly four years of investigating, the committee voted in December 2012 to adopt the report but delayed any vote on declassifying it until the CIA -- the agency that the committee had just concluded had lied to Congress and carried out all of the illegal conduct in the report -- had 60 days to review the report.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >CIA and Senate at war over torture Rand Paul: We must watch the watchers Feinstein: I have asked for an apology Well, 60 days turned into more than six months as the CIA reportedly found almost no factual errors in the report but nonetheless wrote a couple hundred pages reportedly asserting the efficacy of the program and attacking the report's methodology.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The agency, however, wasn't done.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >It then ran a whisper campaign among reporters to disparage the Senate report.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The CIA campaign to hide the truth didn't just stop with foot dragging or writing counter-reports.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >It reportedly went as far as spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee staff's use of computers dedicated for their exclusive use.</sentence>

<sentence cont=1 >The CIA must be held responsible for any laws broken, but it is certainly reasonable to ask why the Senate Intelligence Committee or the White House ever let the agency get its controlling hands on the report in the first place.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Fool the Senate twice, shame on the Senate.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >With the committee poised to vote to submit the torture report for a declassification review and then public release, it is worth asking: Will the Senate risk getting fooled by the CIA a third time CIA Director John Brennan has promised to play nice, saying that if sent the Senate torture report yet again, the CIA would "carry out the review expeditiously." Yes, let's again entrust the report to the agency that broke the law on torture and was so brazen that until this month, its acting CIA general counsel was a lawyer named 1,600 times in the torture report.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Only a fool would be fooled three times.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Feinstein should insist -- and Obama should agree -- that the White House itself conduct the declassification review.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Furthermore, only White House officials who had no role in any of the banned practices described in the report should be involved in the review, and the CIA should be consulted only as needed -- with only CIA officials untainted by torture looped in.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >By law, the president has authority to declassify information, and he surely has the authority to decide the process for declassifying this landmark report.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The CIA should never have had a torture program, never should have lied about what it was doing and never should have been given broad authority to review the Senate oversight report.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Obama cannot now hand the agency a black-out pen to continue to hide the horrors it inflicted around the globe and the harm it caused to our American values.</sentence>

<title>Opinion: Gitmo force feeding is torture - CNN.com</title>
<text>Stop force-feeding inmates and close Gitmo By Vince Warren, Special to CNN updated 5:47 AM EDT, Fri May 10, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Vince Warren: It took 100 men on a hunger strike for Obama to remember he must close Gitmo Warren: Starving is the only way inmates can protest being held 11 years with no charges Obama sent more staff to force feed hunger strikers, which is considered torture, he says Warren: Obama has authority to close prison, it's a ruse that Congress prevents him Editor's note: Vince Warren is the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights , a nonprofit legal and educational organization that works to protect rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. CCR represented clients in two Guantanamo Supreme Court cases and coordinates the work of hundreds of pro bono attorneys representing prisoners there. CNN -- It has taken almost three months and more than 100 men embarking on a life-threatening hunger strike for President Obama to remind himself and the nation why the prison at Guantanamo Bay needs to be closed. Self-starvation is excruciating, but as one of our clients expressed, this is the only way the men at Guantanamo have left to tell the world what it means to be unjustly detained without charge or trial for more than 11 years with no end in sight. Vincent Warren The starvation protest, which began in February, has created headlines around the world. Of the 100 men, 23 are being force fed to keep them alive . As you read this, it's likely that some of the men are being dragged from their cells, strapped to restraint chairs, and a rubber tube inserted up their nose and into their stomachs to pump in liquid dietary supplement. One of the men described the traumatic experience to his attorney as having a razor blade go down through your nose and into your throat. Last week, 40 additional military medical personnel were sent to Guantanamo to assist with the force-feedings, a practice that the American Medical Association condemned as a violation of "core ethical values of the medical profession" and the United Nations condemned as torture and a breach of international law. Force-feedings at Guantanamo are nothing new, and much like indefinite detention, the practice has come to define the prison. In 2005, when the first mass hunger strike at the prison took place, the Bush administration also responded by having medical personnel force-feed the men. Back then the men were fighting for due process and access to attorneys; eight years later and with more than half the prison population cleared for release by the Obama administration itself, the men are asking for an end to their indefinite detention. As President Obama said last week , the prison is "not necessary to keep America safe. It's expensive, it's inefficient, it hurts us in terms of international standing, it lessens cooperation with our allies in counterterrorism efforts." It is also illegal and inhumane, as the United Nations' top independent human rights experts and the international human rights body with jurisdiction over the United States, the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights , reminded the president. Ethics of forced feeding at Guantanamo Lawyer: Political will could close Gitmo Outrage over Gitmo Gitmo hunger strike presents dilemma I would like to believe that if the president could see what lawyers at my organization have witnessed during visits with our clients in the last few weeks, he would act without delay to make good on the promise he made to close Guantanamo Bay four years ago. The toll that starvation and the violence of force-feedings have taken on the men is painful to see. They have lost 30 to 40 pounds, they look skeletal, and many are losing consciousness and coughing up blood. Last we heard, one of our clients weighed 90 pounds. I'd like to believe that if President Obama knew a man like Djamel Ameziane , he would understand that closing the prison is not a matter of political expediency but life or death. Djamel has been cleared for release, the government has said there are no "military rationales" for detaining him further, and other countries have expressed an interest in resettling him because he fears persecution in his home country of Algeria. Yet he continues to languish in a cell years later. What does that do to a man's spirit The president said he continues to believe "we've got to close Guantanamo." But believing is not enough. Believing in the president and having their hopes for justice raised and dashed so many times since the order to close Guantanamo was first signed in 2009 is what drove the men at Guantanamo to put their lives on the line with this hunger strike. Guantanamo is back in the news in a serious way for the first time in years, and it is the men themselves who have succeeded in putting it there, using the only peaceful means they have available to them to demand their lives back. The president has more staff members force-feeding men whom his own administration cleared for release than he has working to transfer them out. It should not take the inevitable deaths that will follow from this crisis for the president to act. He must stop pretending Congress is preventing him from doing anything. Right now he has the authority that Congress provided under the National Defense Authorization Act to start transferring the men who have been cleared using a national security waiver. He also has the power to lift his self-imposed moratorium on transfers to Yemen. Collective punishment based on nationality is as illegal as indefinite detention. The president said the right things last week. He has said the right things before. All it takes now is the humanity and the will to act and end the horror that is Guantanamo prison.</text>

<title>Report: 'Systematic' torture of civilians alleged in northern Myanmar - CNN.com</title>
<text>By Tim Hume, CNN updated 11:38 PM EDT, Tue June 10, 2014 A boy pokes a trash fire in the Jan Mai Kawng IDP camp in Kachin State, Myanmar. About 600 people live in the camp. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A rights group says it has documented more than 60 cases of torture of civilians in Myanmar The alleged torture occurred in Kachin State and northern Shan State over the past three years A 17 year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and state forces ended in 2011 Myanmar's government rejects the report and says torture is not part of military policy CNN -- Myanmar security forces have been accused by a rights group of "systematically" torturing civilians from an ethnic minority in the conflict-stricken state of Kachin. Bangkok-based Fortify Rights released its report on the alleged torture of Kachin civilians on Monday, the third anniversary of the resumption of hostilities between government forces and ethnic Kachin insurgents following a 17 year ceasefire. The report gathered testimony from 78 survivors and witnesses relating to the alleged torture of more than 60 victims by Myanmar's army, police and military intelligence service, since the resumption of fighting. Fortify Rights' executive director Matthew Smith said the alleged victims were perceived to be aligned with the Kachin Independence Army KIA, the ethnic rebel guerrilla force that has battled Myanmar's army for decades. The alleged abuse appeared to have been carried out with the consent of senior officers, he said. "The torture that we've documented is not a secret practice," he said. "When the police, the army or military intelligence are torturing Kachin civilians, they're not attempting to conceal it. They're sending a very loud and clear message to the Kachin population that any sort of sympathy for the KIA, or any activities with the KIA, will be dealt with very severely." The report said torture was most often committed by government troops trying to obtain information on the strength and movements of KIA fighters. Alleged victims reported being stabbed, beaten and having wire tied around their necks, hands and feet. Other claims included that security forces had placed bamboo over their victims' heads or shins, and jumped or stood on it. Some were told to dig their own graves before being released, while others were made to lick their own blood off the ground following prolonged beatings, the report claimed. Other alleged victims said they had been sexually abused while detained. Smith said the alleged abuses, which his group believed constituted war crimes, seemed to be being committed with impunity. "We've documented such consistent practices across many different areas that would indicate that it is certainly a systematic practice and a widespread practice." READ MORE: Myanmar city forgives but doesn't forget sectarian violence The report also described the torture sessions as characterized by a degree of ethnic and religious discrimination, with the offenders often denigrating their victims' ethnicity and Christian faith during the ordeal. "You are Kachin, and we will kill all the Kachin," one victim claimed to have been told. Many Kachin are Christian, while Myanmar is a majority Buddhist country. Ye Htut, a spokesman for Myanmar President Thein Sein, said he had not seen that report, but rejected the allegations of torture, accusing Fortify Rights of "one-sided allegations." "Their report is not concrete evidence," he said. "If they have concrete evidence, they can send it to the government and the government will investigate thoroughly and punish offenders if we find they've committed these crimes. We'll take action according to our laws." He said Myanmar security forces would "never use torture as a weapon in the conflict areas," and stressed that any individuals who did so would be in breach of government policy. "There may be some individuals who commit this crime, but it is not the policy of the military or the government," he said. "You cannot apply the individual action to the government policy. Some U.S. soldiers are making wrongdoing in Afghanistan and Iraq, but we should not say it is the policy of the U.S. military or government." READ MORE: Aung San Suu Kyi and the Rohingya -- has 'The Lady' lost her voice Smith said the report had been provided to the president's office. "If it's not state policy, then they should demonstrate that by credibly investigating and prosecuting those that are responsible for these abuses," he said. "But we're not seeing that, and this has been going on for three years now." Fortify Rights said it shared the concerns expressed by the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tomas Ojea Quintana, over allegations the KIA uses child soldiers, forced labor and landmines. But the report's authors had found no evidence of the KIA using torture. Myanmar has been wracked with internal conflict, with ethnic minorities seeking greater autonomy, since shortly after the country, then known as Burma, gained independence from Britain in 1948. The country's quasi-civilian government, which replaced the military junta following sweeping reforms in 2011, has been seeking a national ceasefire with 16 ethnic guerrilla forces. Since the 17-year ceasefire between the military and KIA forces crumbled in June 2011, the two sides have held numerous peace talks, but fighting continues. The United Nations says that more than 100,000 people have been displaced in Kachin State and the north of neighboring Shan State, home to many Kachin, since the violence resumed. READ MORE: Fears of new unrest as Myanmar ponders monk-backed interfaith marriage ban Amnesty International says the situation faced by the displaced populations, currently housed in over 165 camps, is grave, with ongoing concerns about their access to shelter, clean water and sanitation. It issued a statement saying that the reports of ongoing alleged human rights violations by the military raised "serious questions about the commitment to human rights reforms in the country" and threatened efforts to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire. Myanmar's civil society groups have also reported sexual violence against women in Kachin areas since the resumption of fighting. The Kachin Women's Association Thailand said in a statement that recent attacks by the Myanmar army in Kachin areas threw "strong doubt on the government's sincerity towards the peace process." Citing recent cases of alleged rape by military forces, it called for tackling military sexual violence to be made a matter of priority during peace negotiations.</text>

<title>FDR's grandson: Protect Social Security, don't gut it - CNN.com</title>
<text>Protect Social Security, don't gut it By Jim Roosevelt updated 12:59 PM EDT, Fri August 15, 2014 Franklin Roosevelt signs the 1935 Social Security Act into law. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Jim Roosevelt, grandson of FDR, wants Social Security to thrive well into the future He says Americans today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in poverty This week marks the program's 79th anniversary Editor's note: James Roosevelt Jr., the grandson of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, is a former associate commissioner of the Social Security Administration and is a member of the Democratic National Committee. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- Seventy-nine years ago this week, as he signed the Social Security Act into law, my grandfather, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, observed, "The civilization of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age." The first half of that sentiment carries even more weight today than it did then. Recent decades have witnessed changes in technology, in the workplace, and in the work force, that would have been difficult to imagine in 1935. As our economy continues to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we're finding it necessary to adapt to a new economy that bears little resemblance to that of previous generations. Jim Roosevelt But as for the latter half of that sentiment, it is astonishing is how untrue it rings today. Even without the assurance of walking out the door 40 years down the line with a gold watch and a pension, younger Americans today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in abject poverty. The reason, quite simply, is that Social Security has been one of the most successful programs in our nation's history. According to the Census Bureau, more than 35% of Americans age 65 and older were below the poverty line in 1959. Today, that number is below 10%. Take into consideration the families who receive Social Security benefits on account of the premature death of a parent or disability, and in 2012 Social Security lifted more than 22 million Americans out of poverty. I'll admit that contributing to my appreciation of the Social Security program is that it is one of my grandfather's proudest legacies. The Social Security Act fundamentally transformed America by putting in place a commitment to the most vulnerable members of our society; that commitment has been expanded with the additions of Medicare and Medicaid and strengthened by the reforms put in place by the Affordable Care Act I also had the opportunity to work in the Social Security Administration, which has helped bring to light just how disingenuous are the attacks lobbed against the program's long-term viability. Despite Social Security's extraordinary success, and the program's deep popularity with the American people, it has been targeted with lies and distortions by those who would seek to end the program as we know it based on rigid ideology.

<title>Social Security combats bullet rumors - CNN.com</title>
<text>Social Security combats bullet rumors By Lateef Mungin and Michael Pearson, CNN updated 5:41 AM EDT, Wed September 5, 2012 The Social Security Administration posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow-point bullets last month. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Some question the Social Security Administration's recent bid request for 174,000 hollow-point bullets Bloggers say the agency's police force is preparing for financial collapse and civil unrest The agency characterizes the order as routine and says special agents need them "These investigators have full law enforcement authority," the agency says CNN -- Praise the Internet and pass the ammunition: the blogosphere is roiling with conspiracy theories over a Social Security Administration shopping list for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Depending on whom you believe, police who protect Social Security Administration officers are either preparing for impending financial doom by purchasing lethal ammo to put down rioting citizens, or they're just making a standard purchase of ammunition for a federal police agency. It all began last month when the agency, which is primarily responsible for distributing benefits to the disabled and retired people, posted an announcement seeking bids for 174,000 hollow-point bullets. Why cried some bloggers. Infowars, a website operated by right-wing talk show host Alex Jones, wanted to know if the agency was preparing for "civil unrest." When to take Social Security "Social Security welfare is estimated to keep around 40 per cent of senior citizens out of poverty. Should the tap run dry in the aftermath of an economic collapse which the Federal Reserve has already told top banks to prepare for, domestic disorder could ensue if people are refused their benefits," it said in a post . Each bullet potentially "represents a dead American," wrote retired Maj. Gen. Jerry Curry , an Army vet. "If so, why would the U.S. government want the SSA to kill 174,000 of our citizens, even during a time of civil unrest" Curry wrote on the conservative website The Daily Caller, founded by commentator Tucker Carlson. Conspiracy theorists had previously speculated that a purchase of hollow-point bullets by the Department of Homeland Security was similarly meant to quell impending riots. A few years ago, theorists similarly questioned why the Federal Emergency Management Agency was stockpiling body bags and other supplies, suggesting the agency was preparing for civil collapse. In the face of the furor, the Social Security Administration's public affairs shop -- which spends most of its time issuing releases about speeding disability decisions or looking up benefits information -- issued a statement explaining that its 295 agents need the bullets for target practice and to protect the agency's 66 offices across the nation. "These investigators have full law enforcement authority, including executing search warrants and making arrests," the agency said in an August post . "Our investigators are similar to your state or local police officers. They use traditional investigative techniques, and they are armed when on official duty." Hollow point bullets are standard-issue items for many police agencies, the Social Security Administration said. The bullets expand when they hit a target and can help prevent injuries to bystanders from bullets passing through a body, according to police. Investigators "use this ammunition during their mandatory quarterly firearms qualifications and other training sessions, to ensure agent and public safety," the administration added. This is just the latest in a long history of uniquely American anti-government conspiracy theories, said Kathryn Olmsted, a University of California at Davis history professor and author of "Real Enemies: Conspiracy Theories in American Democracy." That another one would surface in the midst of a contentious election cycle and continued unease over the nation's financial future is not all that surprising, Olmsted said Tuesday. But this one, she said, seems particularly tenuous. "It strikes me as one of the more extreme conspiracy theories," Olmsted said. "I'm surprised it has any traction." Yet it does. "You don't use hollow point bullets for target practice," one Twitter user posted Tuesday. "Sorry we're not buying it social security agency. #youarefullofit."</text>

<title>Social Security number study raises fears - CNN.com</title>
<text>Social Security number study raises fears Story Highlights Social Security numbers fall into patterns, study says Numbers can be guessed if person has your birth date, state where you were born Government says this information has been available; no codes have been cracked Numbers are now assigned at birth, but in future will be assigned randomly CNN -- A report earlier this week that a pair of academics had discovered a way to figure out a person's Social Security number based on information people commonly post online has raised new concerns about identity theft. Professor Alessandro Acquisti says Social Security numbers issued after the late 1980s are vulnerable. The Social Security Administration said the threat is minuscule. Still, the agency plans to change to a random system of assigning the numbers, replacing the current system based on the state and date where the number is assigned. Professor Alessandro Acquisti and researcher Ralph Gross of Carnegie Mellon University said they began by studying a half-million expired Social Security numbers obtained from the "death master file" published by the Social Security Administration. "We can use these death master file records to infer patterns" in the way numbers are assigned, said Acquisti, who then derived formulas to zero in on a range of Social Security numbers that might have been assigned to a person. Because the process depends on the date the Social Security number was assigned, it works best for people born after the late 1980s, when it became common to issue numbers to newborns. Social Security numbers are made up of three segments. The first segment of three numbers represents the state issuing the number. States with a large population, such as New York, cycle through dozens of numbers, while less populous states, such as Wyoming, use only one. The second segment is made up of two numbers that are changed periodically, while the third segments is composed of four numbers that cycle continuously from 0000 to 9999. Don't Miss In Depth: Online Security Knowing a person's state and place of birth, Acquisti would use the death master file to find the numbers of people with nearby birth dates in the same state. Those would be plotted on a graph that would allow Acquisti to try to predict the target person's number. For example, for Oregon in 1996 the first three numbers cycled from 540 to 544, changing every 60 days or so. The middle segment started the year as 47, but 60 days in it changed to 49. And the last four numbers cycled around, also every 60 days or so. To avoid giving criminals too much information, Acquisti and Gross withheld some of the details of their methods. In a small state like Delaware, the report says, for 1 in 20 people the Social Security number can be determined in less than 10 tries. Mark Lassiter of the Social Security Administration said the threat is not significant. "The public should not be alarmed by this report because there is no foolproof method for predicting a person's Social Security number," he said. Indeed, for 90 percent of people, Acquisti wouldn't hit on their full Social Security number even with 1,000 tries. "The method by which Social Security assigns numbers has been a matter of public record for years," said Lassiter. "The suggestion that Mr. Acquisti has cracked a code for predicting an SSN is a dramatic exaggeration." Still, the authors said a determined hacker could use trial and error to try dozens of educated guesses on fraudulent credit applications -- or even use a computer to automate the effort. At a minimum, they say, their findings are a wake-up call for people who have posted their date and state of birth on Web sites like MySpace or Facebook . "This is the challenge we face in our modern technology," Acquisti said. "By interacting so much and exposing so much information, we also sometimes expose ourselves to risk." Starting next year, the government plans to assign numbers randomly, which will protect anyone born after 2010 from mathematical calculations. But for everyone born in the past 20 years, Acquisti said, something besides the Social Security number should be used for bank accounts and credit cards. "Social Security numbers are very bad passwords," he said. "They were not designed to be used in that way."</text>

<title>Social Security increase should be bigger - CNN.com</title>
<text>Social Security increase should be bigger By Monique Morrissey, Special to CNN updated 11:27 AM EDT, Thu October 20, 2011 Senior citizens take a break on a bench during the 8th Annual Healthy Living Festival this summer in Oakland, California. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Social Security recipients will get a 3.6% cost-of-living-adjustment in 2012 Monique Morrissey says it's overdue; others say it's too generous during these hard times She says COLA is based on inflation index for workers and doesn't show seniors' cost of living Morrissey: Calls to reduce COLA bad idea; polls show Americans support increase, not decrease Editor's note: Monique Morrissey is an economist who specializes in retirement issues at the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal research organization in Washington. CNN -- The Social Security Administration has just announced that beneficiaries will receive a 3.6% cost-of-living adjustment in January. The average retired worker will see a $512 increase in annual benefits -- from $14,232 to $14,744 -- though a portion will be offset by higher Medicare premiums. Social Security recipients have had to wait two years for a cost-of-living adjustment, the first time t his has happened since the COLA was introduced in 1975. This is because the COLA was relatively high in 2009 because of a temporary spike in energy prices the previous year, and this was followed by a period of low inflation as the economy languished. With a super committee focused on cutting $1.5 trillion from the federal budget, you may wonder whether we can afford a 3.6% COLA. Some say the increase is overly generous more on this in a moment. To understand why this is not so, you need to understand how the COLA works. The Social Security COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Oddly enough, the CPI-W measures changes in the cost of living for workers, excluding retirees and other Social Security recipients who aren't in the labor force. But this measure doesn't accurately reflect the cost of living for seniors. Seniors have experienced higher inflation because they spend a greater share of their incomes on out-of-pocket medical expenses, and health costs have risen faster than overall inflation in recent decades. An index that specifically tracks the cost of living of seniors has risen roughly 0.2 percentage points faster per year than the CPI-W. Though this may not sound like much, the difference would amount to roughly $1000 more in annual benefits after 20 years if the COLA was tied to the price index for the elderly, as proposed by Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida. But rather than increasing the Social Security COLA to keep up with escalating health costs, most inside-the-beltway discussions these days revolve around adopting a lower COLA as a way to help close Social Security's modest projected shortfall. The super committee may be considering such a move. This is a terrible idea for two reasons. First, Americans across the political spectrum prefer to restore balance through revenue increases rather than benefit cuts; and second, a COLA cut has the greatest impact on the oldest old, who also tend to be the poorest old. A recent survey commissioned by the Institute for Women's Policy Research and the Rockefeller Foundation found that 61% of women and 54% of men supported increasing Social Security benefits. This isn't surprising when you consider that benefits are modest and replace a shrinking share of preretirement earnings even without additional cuts. Nor is this an anomaly: Polls have consistently found that Americans oppose benefit cuts and are willing to pay higher taxes to strengthen the program. So what's the appeal of a flatter COLA for beltway budget cutters It's a stealth benefit cut masquerading as a technical fix. The rationale is that the current price index overstates inflation because it doesn't fully account for the ability of consumers to change their buying habits in response to price changes. In other words, if the price of oranges goes up, people will buy more apples and fewer oranges, and this change isn't fully reflected in the CPI-W even though the consumption "basket" evolves over time to put more weight on apples and less on oranges. The problem with this argument is that it doesn't look at the growth in costs actual beneficiaries face over time. Not only are seniors harder hit by escalating medical costs than the working-age population, but since they have roughly half the household incomes, they spend a greater share on necessities like rent and utilities. It's quite possible that the CPI-W actually overstates the ability of beneficiaries to substitute apples for oranges, or IPods for orthopedic shoes. If so, then a 3.6% COLA is not enough, not too much. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Monique Morrissey.</text>

<sentence cont=0 >A recent survey commissioned by the Institute for Women's Policy Research and the Rockefeller Foundation found that 61% of women and 54% of men supported increasing Social Security benefits.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >This isn't surprising when you consider that benefits are modest and replace a shrinking share of preretirement earnings even without additional cuts.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Nor is this an anomaly: Polls have consistently found that Americans oppose benefit cuts and are willing to pay higher taxes to strengthen the program.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >So what's the appeal of a flatter COLA for beltway budget cutters It's a stealth benefit cut masquerading as a technical fix.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The rationale is that the current price index overstates inflation because it doesn't fully account for the ability of consumers to change their buying habits in response to price changes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >In other words, if the price of oranges goes up, people will buy more apples and fewer oranges, and this change isn't fully reflected in the CPI-W even though the consumption "basket" evolves over time to put more weight on apples and less on oranges.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The problem with this argument is that it doesn't look at the growth in costs actual beneficiaries face over time.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Not only are seniors harder hit by escalating medical costs than the working-age population, but since they have roughly half the household incomes, they spend a greater share on necessities like rent and utilities.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >It's quite possible that the CPI-W actually overstates the ability of beneficiaries to substitute apples for oranges, or IPods for orthopedic shoes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >If so, then a 3.6% COLA is not enough, not too much.</sentence>

<title>Debt panel 'goes there' on Social Security - CNN.com</title>
<text>Debt panel 'goes there' on Social Security By Ruben Navarrette, Jr., CNN Contributor STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette says debt reduction panel to vote on controversial recommendations He says it may be time for serious national discussion on how to cut debt Panel chairmen propose changes to Social Security, a "third rail" avoided by politicians Navarrette: Program is a drain, everyone knows it's a problem; chairs' call painful, necessary Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist, an NPR commentator and a regular contributor to CNN.com San Diego, California CNN -- As topics go, reducing the national debt, revamping the tax system, and reforming entitlements are awfully dry. So how contentious, emotional and divisive would you expect a national discussion of these items to be You might be surprised. Things could get pretty heated. We're about to find out how much. These topics are on the front burner this week, and they're likely to stay there for months to come. All because a bipartisan presidential commission on debt reduction, which was co-chaired by Democrat Erskine Bowles and Republican Alan Simpson, released its final report Wednesday. The commission's 18 members will vote on the final recommendations on Friday. To formally make those recommendations to Congress, 14 members of the commission will need to vote for the report. This could be the right time to have a serious national conversation about debt reduction and related issues. A recent USA Today/Gallup Poll found that 39 percent of Americans believe cutting the debt is the best medicine for the ailing U.S. economy. That beat all the other options, such as cutting taxes or undergoing another round of stimulus spending. Besides offering suggestions for reforming the tax code and cutting domestic and defense spending to remove nearly $4 trillion from deficits over the next 10 years, the most important thing the members of the Bowles/Simpson commission did was to grab hold of the dreaded "third rail" -- Social Security -- and offer specific changes that could keep it solvent for 75 years. Debt: National security threat U.S. debt: How bad could it get Obama: 'Government must sacrifice' Erskine Bowles To be fair, that's 75 years longer than we've gotten from anyone else in Washington. There is virtually no one in the land of the risk averse, in either party, who wants to go anywhere near the radioactive subject of Social Security. That's because fixing America's most beloved entitlement program means tinkering with it. And the so-called Gray Panthers, and a cadre of other arm-twisting pressure groups for the elderly, have let it be known that they will take out anyone who tinkers with it. And who taught me this It was Al Simpson, who happens to have been one of my professors in graduate school. This was 10 years ago, and the former Senate Majority Leader was already speaking freely Al doesn't know how to speak any other way about how Congress deliberately avoided fixing Social Security even though it was speeding toward insolvency because lawmakers feared the backlash. Think Tea Party X 10. Simpson used to tell the class that politics is a contact sport. Indifference is not an option. You either take part, or you get taken apart. For too long, younger workers in America -- that is, those under the age of 50 -- have been taken apart because they don't vote in the percentages they should. So politicians aren't afraid of them in the way that they fear the elderly. The result is a Social Security system that amounts to a massive inter-generational transfer of wealth. There is no "lock box." Every generation pays for the preceding one. The money goes out as quickly as it comes in. For the latter part of the 20th Century, more than 70 million baby boomers had no problem paying for the World War II generation because, well, there were more than 70 million of them. But imagine the burden on younger workers of having to keep the children of the 1960's in a comfy retirement -- especially since Americans are living longer. In 1946, the cost of supporting one retiree was split between 42 workers. Now, we're approaching the point where two workers will support each retiree. The trouble begins in 2016 when, experts say, more funds will be going out in benefits than will be coming in as payroll taxes. Possible fixes include raising the retirement age, cutting benefits, and means-testing the program so that millionaires forgo their payout. It should all be on the table. Everyone knows there is a problem. But few people in Washington have the guts to even talk about it, let alone actually try to do something about it. In that respect, Bowles and Simpson have really outdone themselves with this report. Working since April, they have -- in a deliberate and thoughtful way -- proposed what amounts to a complete overhaul of a federal government that is too big, grows too fast, spends too much, and lumbers along too slowly. The report isn't perfect. And not everything they suggest will be popular. In fact, each item on the list comes attached to its own special interest that is likely to fight tooth and nail rather than give up an inch. In the face of crisis, Americans tend to want a simple diagnosis and pain-free solutions. From this commission, they didn't get either. What they got instead was something politicians are, these days, more and more reluctant to give the people who elect them: the hard and uncomfortable truth.

<title>Obama hammers McCain over Social Security - CNN.com</title>
<text>Obama hammers McCain over Social Security Story Highlights Obama says if McCain becomes president, he'll privatize Social Security Obama: McCain is "the one who wants to gamble with your life savings" Candidates exchange accusations of ties to failed mortgage lenders New CNN Poll of Polls shows Obama leading in Michigan From Ed Hornick, Sasha Johnson and Paul Steinhauser CNN DAYTONA BEACH, Florida CNN -- Sen. Barack Obama told voters in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday that if Sen. John McCain became president, he would privatize their Social Security. It's a debate over the program that could resurface as a major issue in the closing weeks of the campaign, given the wild swings in financial markets. "If my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it would've had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week. Millions would've watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes," he said. "I know Sen. McCain is talking about a 'casino culture' on Wall Street, but the fact is, he's the one who wants to gamble with your life savings, and that is not going to happen when I'm president. When I'm president, we're not going to gamble with Social Security." The McCain campaign disputed Obama's assertion, calling it "a desperate attempt to gain political advantage using scare tactics and deceit." Election Center: Where the candidates stand on Social Security Obama also highlighted an article McCain penned in this month's issue of the American Academy of Actuaries magazine, called "Contingencies," in which he said consumers would have more choices for health insurance products if the market was opened to more "vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking." "He wants to run health care like they've been running Wall Street. Well, senator, I know some folks on Main Street who aren't going to think that's such a good idea," Obama said. Listen to Obama's Saturday radio address » The Democratic nominee has one more event in Jacksonville before heading to North Carolina for an event Sunday in Charlotte. The campaign announced that Obama will spend several days next week in Tampa, Florida -- a spot along the Interstate 4 corridor that is considered a crucial swing vote region for both candidates -- prepping for Friday's first presidential debate. In a radio address Saturday, McCain blasted Obama's ties to failed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Sen. Obama was taking their money. He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairman of the committee that oversees them," he added. Fact Check: Did Obama 'profit' from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Last week, Obama's campaign highlighted the fact that several of McCain's top advisers had lobbied on behalf of the two lenders. Nonetheless, the McCain campaign released an ad Friday linking Obama to former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines. "Who advises him" the female announcer asks. "The [Washington] Post says it's Franklin Raines, for 'advice on mortgage and housing policy.' " But on Saturday, Obama debunked those accusations. "My opponent attacked me for being associated with a Fannie Mae guy who I met once and talked to for maybe five minutes. He did a TV ad saying this guy was my adviser. The guy actually had to send out a letter saying, 'That's not true. I actually don't really talk to the guy,' " Obama said. And the head of the lobbying shop at Fannie Mae turned around and said, 'Wait a minute. When I see photographs of Sen. McCain's staff, it looks to me like the team of lobbyists who used to report to me.'" Also Friday, McCain's team fired off an ad about Obama's relationship with Jim Johnson, the former Fannie Mae chairman who resigned as head of the Democrat's vice presidential vetting team after allegations that he had received preferential terms on a mortgage from Countrywide Financial. Watch an analysis of the new political ads » Meanwhile, McCain will stop by his 50-year class reunion Saturday at the U.S. Naval Academy football game. The Arizona senator, who often mentions his time as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam era, graduated from the Academy in 1958 along with John Poindexter and Robert "Bud" McFarlane, two consecutive national security advisers under President Reagan who played a role in the Iran-Contra affair. Also Saturday, a new CNN poll of polls in Michigan suggests that Obama has a 5-point lead over McCain, 47 percent to 42 percent, with 11 percent of voters undecided. Seventeen electoral votes are up for grabs in Michigan. The current financial crisis from Wall Street to Main Street will more than likely be a major factor in Michigan, a state dealing with hard economic times. "The struggling economy could be Obama's trump card," CNN Senior Political Researcher Alan Silverleib noted. "Obama is doing slightly better in CNN's Michigan poll of polls than in CNN's national poll of polls in large part because Michigan is ground zero when it comes to the country's current economic hardship. The unsettling news from Wall Street over the last few days could play to Obama's advantage, especially in the Rust Belt," Silverleib added. Interactive: CNN's Electoral Map Michigan has voted for the Democratic candidate in the past four presidential elections, but it was quite close in 2004, with Sen. John Kerry beating President Bush there by just 3 points. The latest CNN poll of polls is an average of the three most recent surveys in Michigan. They are a Big Ten Battleground poll conducted September 14-17, an EPIC/MRA survey taken on the same days and a Marist poll conducted September 16-17.</text>

<title>Obama: Social Security won't be privatized - CNN.com</title>
<text>Seattle He said Social Security needed adjustments, rather than a total overhaul. "There are some fairly modest changes that can be made without any newfangled schemes that can keep it running for 75 years so everybody gets what they deserve," Obama said. While citing steps his administration has taken to spur recovery from the recession, Obama also warned that more work needed to be done. He said the housing market remains a "big drag" on the economy and will take more time to recover. Overbuilding in the boom years that preceded the economic recession has resulted in too many houses available for the level of demand, the president said. "It is going to take time to absorb this inventory that is just too high," Obama said. "There's no quick way to do it." Before the meeting, Obama huddled around the kitchen table with the Columbus family of Rhonda and Joe Weithman to talk about how his administration's economic stimulus spending has helped it. The Recovery Act funded local infrastructure projects like a new police station that provided work for the small architectural firm co-owned by Joe Weithman, helping it stay in business, Obama said. In addition, the administration subsidized COBRA health insurance benefits, which allowed Rhonda Weithman to maintain the family's insurance coverage after she lost her job, he said. The trip was Obama's ninth to Ohio since taking office. Ohio will likely be a key state in upcoming elections. Later Wednesday, Obama was to attend a fundraiser for Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, before heading to Miami Beach, Florida, for events with Senate candidate Kendrick Meek and gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink. On Tuesday, Obama held a round-table discussion with three Seattle, Washington, business owners -- an innkeeper, a baker and a pizza maker. The president cited how each has been helped by his administration's policies intended to spur recovery from the recession. He also renewed his call for the U.S. Senate to pass a jobs bill aimed at helping small businesses. Senate Republicans have filibustered the measure, which would provide tax breaks for small businesses and expand available capital to them through local banks. Obama insisted the Senate would take up the bill again immediately after returning from its August recess. The measure would provide immediate help to small-business owners, who are the backbone of the U.S. economy, Obama said. "They are who this bill is for," he said of the Seattle-area small-business owners who flanked him. "They will see the benefits right away." The Small Business Jobs and Credit Act, stalled in the Senate, would authorize the creation of a $30 billion lending fund. The Treasury Department would run the program, which would deliver ultra-cheap capital to community banks, defined as those with less than $10 billion in total assets. Other key components of the bill would provide $12 billion worth of tax relief for small businesses between 2010 and 2020, according to a preliminary estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. The bill also would increase Small Business Administration loan limits and extend loan sweeteners through the end of the year. It would offer a slew of tax cuts for small businesses to encourage both investment and entrepreneurship. And the legislation would provide $1.5 billion in grants to state lending programs that can't turn to empty state coffers for more cash. Share this on:</text>

<title>Student sues Barneys department store, NYPD, alleges racial profiling - CNN.com</title>
<text>Student sues Barneys department store, NYPD, alleges racial profiling By Morgan Winsor, CNN updated 3:36 PM EDT, Fri October 25, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: "Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination," company says College of Technology student bought a belt at the department store, attorney says He says two undercover officers stopped him, accused him of using a fraudulent card He was handcuffed, taken to a police station and held for two hours, attorney says CNN -- An African-American college student is suing Barneys New York and the city's police department, saying he was racially profiled and later detained by police, according to court documents filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. New York City College of Technology student Trayon Christian, who was 18 at the time, entered Barneys New York on Madison Avenue on April 29 to buy a Ferragamo belt he had seen rappers wear on television, Christian's attorney, Michael Palillo, told CNN on Wednesday. When Christian went to pay for the belt with his debit card at a register, a Barneys cashier asked for identification. Christian showed the cashier his driver's license, paid for the belt with his card, signed the receipt and left the luxury department store with the belt in a Barneys bag. He walked a block before two undercover police officers stopped him, Palillo said. Hollywood couple stopped by police, say they were racially profiled The officers asked Christian for his identification and asked what was in the Barneys bag. When they saw the designer belt, they asked him how he was able to afford it, Palillo said. The officers allegedly accused him of purchasing the belt with a fraudulent card and said they had received a call from Barneys, according to Palillo. In a prepared statement, a Barneys representative said that Barneys New York "typically does not comment on pending litigation." The representative said that in this instance, the company felt compelled to say "that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights." Feds: Two Connecticut cops found guilty of civil rights violations against Latinos The two officers handcuffed Christian on the sidewalk and placed him into a police vehicle, according to the court documents filed Monday. Christian was detained in a holding cell for two hours and interrogated, as police contacted Chase Bank to check his card, Palillo said. When they confirmed that his card was valid, police released Christian and apologized, Palillo said. "But it wasn't a sincere 'sorry,' more of a matter-of-fact 'sorry,' " he added. The New York Police Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Palillo said this is a clear case of racial profiling by the department store and police. "This is an outrage. He committed no crime," he said. "He's a young black male who likes fashion." Palillo recently received a call from another man who said he experienced a similar incident at Barneys -- an injustice that appears to happen too often, Palillo said. "You really hate to think that in today's day and age that people are still being judged by the color of their skin," he said.</text>

<title>Man alleges racial profiling in videotaped arrest - CNN.com</title>
<text>Minnesota man alleges racial profiling in videotaped arrest By Laura Ly, CNN updated 10:43 PM EDT, Thu September 4, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Man says he was arrested for sitting in a public area Police: "Video does not show the totality of the circumstances" St. Paul police chief says an investigation is underway, promises transparency CNN -- The video goes dark, but you can still hear the man screaming and pleading for help after police officers allegedly use a stun gun on him. "Someone help me, someone please help me!" he yells. "I haven't done anything wrong!" He continues to struggle, asking the officers what he's done, accuses them of unnecessary assault, and tells them he needs to go pick up his kids from daycare. Another voice is heard: "Too late. You're going to jail." The video was filmed by Chris Lollie, an African-American man who lives in St. Paul, Minnesota. It purports to show him being Tasered and arrested by white police officers in January. The video was published to YouTube on August 26, and has nearly 1.2 million views and over 4,400 comments -- most of them criticizing the police as another example of excessive force. At the time, police confiscated the video and Lollie was charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct and obstruction of the legal process. Six months later, the video was returned to him and all of the charges were dismissed, according to police. 'Can somebody help me' For Lollie, however, the incident is far from over. Lollie told officers in late January that he was waiting on benches in the First National Bank Building in downtown St. Paul before picking up his kids from daycare. A security officer reportedly asked him to leave the area, stating that he was in a private "employees only" area. Lollie said he was sitting in a known public area and there were no signs designating the area as private. He refused to leave. St. Paul police were called and a female officer began to question him as they both walked toward his children's daycare. Lollie is seen walking with the officer, who says she wants to find out who he is and what the problem was. Lollie tells the officer that he isn't required to give his identity if he hasn't broken any laws -- a right that the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota has confirmed. "The problem is I'm black. That's the problem. No, it really is. Because I didn't do anything wrong," Lollie tells her. Two male police officers join them and tell Lollie he's going to jail. One officer tells Lollie to put his hands behind his back, "otherwise this is going to get ugly." Lollie presumably falls to the ground and the video goes black as officers attempt to restrain him. The audio continues. "Can somebody help me" Lollie cries. "That's my kids right there, my kids are right there!" Police: Video does not show entire story Sounds of what appears to be children wailing can be heard in the background. Lollie continues to plead for someone to help him. He begins to get angry, uses expletives and accuses the officers of racial profiling and assault. "I don't have any weapons. You're the ones with the weapons here," he says. The video ends with an officer telling him again that he's going to jail. Lollie continues to maintain his innocence as he is presumably led away by officers. Black community leaders met with the St. Paul Police Department on Monday to discuss the January arrest. At a joint news conference afterward, Rev. Charles Gill of the St. Paul Black Ministerial Alliance said that they "do have some concerns regarding the level of aggression regarding the two male officers at this time." The ACLU of Minnesota voiced its concerns on Twitter, calling the video "disturbing." The St. Paul Police Department has responded on its Facebook page, stating, "As is often the case, the video does not show the totality of the circumstances." "At one point, the officers believed he might either run or fight with them. It was then that officers took steps to take him into custody. He pulled away and resisted officers' lawful orders. They then used the force necessary to safely take him into custody," the statement read. A full investigation of the incident is underway. St. Paul Police Chief Tom Smith promised transparency. "I can tell you, even the officers involved will welcome this investigation," he said Monday. CNN affiliate WCCO reported that the officers were not disciplined after an internal investigation. Lollie plans to file a formal complaint.</text>

<title>Racial profiling law passes in Connecticut - CNN.com</title>
<text>Racial profiling law passes in Connecticut By the CNN Wire Staff updated 5:38 AM EDT, Tue May 8, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Connecticut's House of Representatives passes an anti-racial profiling law The state Senate earlier passed the bill; the governor says he will sign it It mandates police bar discrimination in who they stop, detain or search Months ago, 4 East Haven police were arrested in a federal racial profiling probe CNN -- A few months after four East Haven police officers were arrested for allegedly targeting and harassing Latinos, Connecticut's state legislature passed a bill Monday to beef up safeguards against racial profiling. Titled "An Act Concerning Traffic Stop Information," SB 364 mandates that local and state law enforcement agencies adopt their own "written policy that prohibits the stopping, detention or search of any person when such action is solely motivated by considerations of race, color, ethnicity, age, gender or sexual orientation, and the action would constitute a violation of the civil rights of the person." In addition, the legislation sets up reporting requirements for police whenever they conduct traffic stop, as well as a system for citizen complaints or for state authorities to collect and assess pertinent data from municipal departments. Initially passed by the state Senate on April 19, the legislation made it through the House of Representatives on Monday and is now expected to be signed by Gov. Dannel Malloy. "I will continue to insist that every effort is taken to protect individual rights in every community and that racial profiling is eliminated," Malloy said Monday in a statement. "This is a real problem that deserves a real solution, and my administration is committed to carrying out the spirit and letter of this law." Connecticut priest helps Latinos If and when the bill goes into affect, those pulled over after January 1, 2013, would get a copy of the "standardized form" filled out by police containing details about the driver and circumstances of their case. Those who feel they were profiled due to their race, color, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation can file a complaint, which must be reviewed by the local police department and be passed on to a state agency. The bill doesn't mention any locality or case specifically. But it follows the arrests, in January, of an East Haven police sergeant and three officers following a federal investigation into racial profiling. They all pleaded not guilty. A civil lawsuit has also been filed related to that case. According to a federal indictment, the four allegedly conspired to "injure, oppress, threaten and intimidate various members of the East Haven community" by profiling Latino residents during traffic stops, performing illegal searches and harassing Latino business owners and their advocates. The men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees, made false arrests -- including a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation, prosecutors said. The men also thwarted a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct, authorities said, calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators. "They behaved like bullies with badges," said Janice Fedarcyk, assistant FBI director in New York. Many Latino residents of East Haven -- who make up about 10.3% of the town's roughly 29,000 people -- say that, for years, they have had to contend with an overly aggressive police force. "They always come by and bother us," said Esdras Marin, a manager at La Bamba, a Latino-owned bar and restaurant named in the indictment. "Police come in two or three times a month and ask everyone in the restaurant for their identification," he said. "And if you don't have it, they threaten us and say they're going to call the immigration office." The Rev. James Manship of St. Rose of Lima Church, a plaintiff in the civil suit , has accused since retired police Chief Leonard Gallo of fostering "a racist and dishonest police force" in East Haven.</text>

<title>CNN.com - New federal guidelines ban racial profiling - Jun. 17, 2003</title>
<text>New federal guidelines ban racial profiling Justice Department allows exceptions for terrorism probes Story Tools  Ashcroft calls for end to racial profiling   WASHINGTON CNN -- The Justice Department issued guidelines Tuesday designed to end racial profiling by federal agents in routine police work but allow the use of race and ethnicity to identify terrorism suspects. The directives, approved by President Bush, forbid federal agents in all 70 agencies that have police powers from considering race or ethnicity in such routine practices as stopping drivers for traffic violations, even though such practices might not be prohibited under the Constitution or federal laws. However, in the government's effort to identify terrorists, the new guidelines allow any and all practices that do not violate federal laws or the Constitution, officials said. Therefore, the arrests and detentions of Middle Eastern immigration violators stemming from the post-September 11, 2001, investigation would be permissible, a top Justice Department official said. Federal law enforcement officials also might continue to rely upon specific descriptions of the physical appearance of criminal suspects in particular cases. "Today's guidance ... is the clearest and most comprehensive statement and guidance regarding the consideration of race and ethnicity in law enforcement activities from any administration, ever," said Assistant Attorney General Ralph Boyd Jr. "We've done our very best to get it right. We think we have." The ACLU and other critics said they think otherwise. "The guidelines acknowledge racial profiling as a national concern but do nothing to stop it," said Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU office in Washington. "The new policy guidelines provide no rights or remedies." Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said most complaints of racial profiling come from state and local police agencies, and that congressional action is needed to end the practice. "While these guidelines send a signal, they are not a replacement for the enactment of comprehensive federal antiprofiling legislation," Conyers said. Report finds little government profiling The guidelines cover only federal agencies, not state and local police agencies. Boyd said the administration hopes state and local officials will use the federal policies as a "model" where policies do not exist. We've done our very best to get it right. We think we have. -- Ralph Boyd Jr., assistant attorney general Boyd released copies of the guidelines along with a report compiled by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson that examines the extent of racial profiling by the federal government. The internal study found no widespread problem. "Although any incident of racial profiling is unacceptable, the information provided by federal agencies ... did not disclose any basis for concluding that racial profiling is a systemic problem within the federal law enforcement community," according to Thompson's report. But the governmentwide survey found that most agencies had no policy or training to deal with the issue. "As of February 2002, only four of the 18 'first-tier' agencies [FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Customs, and U.S. Capitol Police] had policies that specifically prohibited racial profiling," according to the report. Officials said the study of racial profiling began before the September 11 attacks, when the issue was most closely associated with efforts to combat drug trafficking. Civil rights organizations charged that blacks in particular were targeted by zealous officials. Since the attacks, the larger focus has centered on charges by Arab-American organizations that their communities have been unfairly targeted by federal agencies. Issues in conflict The Justice Department report reviewed the range of complaints from racial and ethnic groups and reflected on the complexity of the problems. "The FBI and Customs have been accused of unfairly targeting Arab-Americans as potential terrorists," the report said. "Conversely, the Department of Transportation has been criticized in the wake of September 11 for failing to take into account race and ethnicity in determining which airline passengers to subject to enhanced security screening procedures." The new guidelines announced Tuesday attempted to address the sometimes-conflicting issues. "The guidance recognizes that race and ethnicity may properly play a role in terrorist identification and suppression, but only under narrow circumstances permitted by our nation's laws and the Constitution of the United States," Boyd said. "The policy guidance emphasizes that even in the national security context, reliance on mere generalized racial or ethnic stereotypes remains forbidden." CNN Justice producer Terry Frieden contributed to this report. Reuters contributed to this report. Story Tools</text>

<title>Racial profiling still a problem in U.S., groups tell U.N. panel - CNN.com</title>
<text>Racial profiling still a problem in U.S., groups tell U.N. panel Story Highlights ACLU, Rights Working Group say U.S. authorities continue to discriminate Report is response to Bush administration document citing progress Groups say government initiatives disproportionately victimize people of color Report offers details of racial profiling in each state, calls for fixing "failed policies" CNN -- Driving through Mississippi on his way from Texas to Georgia, Hiran Medina was pulled over, and he consented when a deputy asked to search his vehicle. Justice Department guidelines to curtail profiling don't apply to local agencies, groups complain. After the Hinds County deputy found $5,000, Medina said, he was handcuffed and told that the money was being seized, and that unless he took legal action against the county within 30 days, the money would be forfeited to the sheriff's department. Medina, a Latino man, was released, however. While Medina's money was returned after he and the American Civil Liberties Union told the story to media outlets, the ACLU points to the incident in a report released Wednesday to demonstrate the kind of racial profiling by authorities that, it says, remains a problem nationwide. The report, jointly released with the Rights Working Group, was submitted Wednesday to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In it, the organizations blame government policies for contributing to the issue. The Bush administration told the committee in January that the government was taking steps to eliminate profiling, relying on 2003 Justice Department guidance to federal law enforcement agents, the groups say. "However, that document doesn't cover profiling based on religion or national origin, doesn't apply to state or local law enforcement agencies and doesn't include any mechanisms for enforcement or punishment for violating the recommendations," according to a statement accompanying the report. "It also contains a blanket exception to the recommendations in cases of 'national security' or 'border integrity.' "As a result of the U.S. reliance on the vague Justice Department guidance and other Bush policies, people of color have been disproportionately victimized through various government initiatives, including FBI surveillance and questioning, special registration programs, border stops, immigration enforcement programs and the creation of 'no fly lists,' " the statement said. Don't Miss Commentary: 'Post-racial' America isn't here yet "Instead of curbing racial profiling, the overbroad national security and border integrity exceptions in the Justice Department guidance have actually promoted profiling and created justification for state and local law enforcement agents to racially profile those who are or appear to be Arab, Muslim, South Asian or Latino," said Margaret Huang, executive director of the Rights Working Group, which aims to protect civil and human rights , according to its Web site. "We hope the Obama administration will fix the failed policies of the Bush administration and live up to its commitment to end racial profiling in the United States." The organizations submitted the report to the committee in response to the Bush administration's claims, made before President Obama took office. The groups note Obama's appointment of Attorney General Eric Holder, "who has stated that racial profiling is not good law enforcement and is committed to combating this practice." In the report, they urge the Obama administration, Congress and state and local governments to consider its findings. Fewer forms of overt discrimination remain in existence, according to the report, but "de facto racial disparities " continue to perpetuate discrimination. Among them, according to the report, are the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which requires certain non-immigrants to register at ports of entry; guidelines for domestic FBI operations, which the groups say open the door to abuse of power and racial profiling; Customs and Border Protection guidelines that the groups say are "problematic" and cause unjust treatment of people at airports and border crossings; and the 287g program, which permits local police to enforce immigration laws. The report also accuses the federal government of encouraging raids of immigrant communities, particularly Latino ones. "These policies have unjustly expanded the purview of and undermine basic trust in local law enforcement, alienated immigrant communities and created an atmosphere of fear." Asked to respond to the report, Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyar told CNN, "The fair, equal and vigorous enforcement of our nation's civil rights and anti-discrimination laws is a clear priority of this administration's Justice Department ." The FBI and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. The report offers details of racial profiling in each state, using either data such as lawsuits, other studies or anecdotal evidence gleaned from human and civil rights groups or media reports. The U.N. committee is expected to consider the report, along with the U.S. government's January submission and the submissions of other organizations, in its August session, according to the statement. The committee will then issue recommendations to the federal government regarding its human rights obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a treaty signed and ratified by the United States in 1994. Under that treaty, according to the human rights organizations, countries are required to review national, state and local policies and amend or repeal laws deemed to be creating or perpetuating discrimination.</text>

<title>Why profiling doesn't work - CNN.com</title>
<text>Richard Reid Editor's Note: Arsalan Iftikhar is an international human rights lawyer, founder of TheMuslimGuy.com and Legal Fellow for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a nonprofit research organization, in Washington. CNN -- In light of the botched Christmas Day airliner bombing aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit, the Transportation Security Administration has announced new enhanced "guidelines" requiring airline passengers traveling from and through 14 different countries to undergo especially rigorous security screening before being able to fly into the United States. Under these new TSA guidelines, security screeners will conduct "full pat-down body checks" and extensive carry-on luggage checks for all passengers traveling from a country which the U.S. considers to be a "security risk." These 14 countries are: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Additionally, passengers traveling from any other foreign country may also be checked at 'random' as well. These new rules mean that "every individual flying into the U.S. from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening," the TSA said. On its face, this clear use of ethnic, racial and religious profiling will not achieve greater security in the long term for our country. In fact, by targeting only certain passengers for additional screening, "blind spots" can be easily identified and duplicitously exploited by violent extremists wishing our country harm. Defenders of the new rules might say they're only profiling people coming from certain countries, but the fact that 13 of the 14 are Muslim countries makes clear the religious nature of the profiling. This new policy deeply undermines the Obama administration's stated commitment to civil rights, equality before the law, and a much-needed effort to rebuild U.S.-Muslim world relations since the disastrous presidency of George W. Bush. Under international law, countries including the United States that use race, color, ethnicity, religion or nationality as a proxy for criminal suspicion are in violation of international standards against racial discrimination and multiple treaties to which the U.S. is a party. These include the U.N. Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination CERD and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR. The clear alternative is for law enforcement agencies to focus on actual criminal behavior rather than solely on characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, or nationality. Senior international security experts have suggested, for example, that such an approach would have increased the chances that suspected shoe-bomber Richard Reid would have been stopped before he successfully boarded an airplane he intended to attack in December 2001. Among the red flags were that Reid bought a one-way ticket with cash and had no checked luggage. For years, the concept of "racial profiling" has reportedly undermined important terrorist investigations here in the United States. Most notably, these examples include the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in which the two white male domestic terrorists, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, were able to flee while officers operated on the theory that the act had been committed by "Arab terrorists" for the first 48 hours of the investigation. Similarly, during the October 2002 Washington-area sniper investigation, the African-American man and boy ultimately accused of the crime reportedly were able to pass through multiple road blocks with the alleged murder weapon in their possession, in part, because police 'profilers' theorized the crime had been committed by a white male acting alone. According to a report last summer by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Rights Working Group to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination: "Both Democratic and Republican administrations [in the United States] have acknowledged that racial profiling is unconstitutional, socially corrupting and counter-productive, yet this unjustifiable practice remains a stain on American democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality." In fact, not only do such "racial profiling" practices waste limited resources, they simply make us less safe. For example, the arrests of John Walker Lindh a white, middle-class man better known as the 'American Taliban' and Richard Reid a British citizen of West Indian and European ancestry now serving a life sentence at the Supermax prison in Colorado confirm that effective law enforcement techniques must rely solely on criminal behavior and not race, religion or nationality in order to ensure our citizens' security. As the San Diego Union-Tribune said in an editorial: "The minute U.S. officials put out the word that they're not scrutinizing people with blond hair and blue eyes is the minute that al Qaeda starts recruiting people with blond hair and blue eyes. Would looking for Arab-Americans have turned up a passenger that resembled "American Taliban" fighter John Walker Lindh Would applying extra scrutiny to people with foreign-sounding names have kept would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid off a plane" Of course not. Even conservative Republicans like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have argued that behavioral and not racial/ethnic profiling is the best way to prevent terrorist attacks on our country. "We need to have the knowledge to be able to profile based on behavior," Mr. Gingrich recently said on ABC's "Good Morning America" while discussing the recent Christmas Day foiled bombing. "Not racial profiling or ethnic profiling, but profiling based on behavior and then, frankly, discriminating based on behavior," he continued during the same interview. As our national debate on the phenomenon of "racial profiling" emerges once again, let's remember these words of the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Conyers of Michigan: "If Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were alive today ... he would tell us we must not allow the horrific acts of terror that our nation has endured to slowly and subversively destroy the foundation of our democracy."

<text>Occupy Wall Street: An experiment in consensus-building By Steve Kastenbaum, CNN Radio National Correspondent updated 3:04 PM EDT, Tue October 18, 2011 Occupy Wall Street supporters take part in the Park Avenue millionaires protest in New York on October 11. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Occupy Wall Street has lasted more than a month Protesters get organized with daily meetings called their General Assembly Protesters say this is democracy in action, but the movement's future remains unclear Decision-making process, use of inclusivity can be slow and messy, but movement is growing Are you attending protests Send us your photos and videos , and follow the worldwide movement on CNN's Open Story . New York CNN -- In Manhattan's protest hub, the big decisions are made by consensus. Each day in the privately owned Zuccotti Park, where Wall Street protesters have encamped for more than a month, demonstrators engage in a slow, seemingly cumbersome process of making their voices heard. The group, which calls itself Occupy Wall Street, arranges in a half-circle inside the city's financial district for what demonstrators say is their General Assembly, listening to the concerns of those who decide to participate before voting on issues thought to affect them all. Police prevent the use of loudspeakers. So the group, undeterred, instead echoes the voice of whomever is speaking, rendering their comments much more audible to the hundreds that gather each day. And their topics range: From the practical such as where to march and when to the mundane like concerns about trash collection, nothing reaches a conclusion until almost the entire group agrees. The meetings, meanwhile, have cropped up in other cities, while similar demonstrations have taken hold in dozens of cities nationwide and around the world. The protesters in Zuccotti Park commonly say it's democracy in action, and it works. "The idea of a General Assembly -- a place where people can air their grievances against the government -- that does not happen anymore in America," said Lorenzo Serna, a protester and camp volunteer. "We have created that space here, so I already think we are a success." But the process can be messy. At a recent General Assembly meeting in New York, a demonstrator -- unhappy with the agreed-to rules banning drugs and alcohol -- decided he would be disruptive, even announcing his intention to the group. The group, however, permitted his comments, apparently not wanting to alienate anyone. Earlier this month, Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, showed up at an Occupy Wall Street demonstration in Atlanta and asked if he could address the crowd. The distinguished civil rights leader wanted to speak to the people in his district, and at first, it looked like he had the support of the group. But then, one man, while acknowledging Lewis' contributions to society, said the Occupy Wall Street movement is a Democratic process, "in which no singular human being is inherently more valuable than any other human being." That led to a 10-minute group discussion before it was decided by consensus that Lewis should not be allowed to speak. Inside Occupy Wall Street Supplies going to Wall St. protesters Consensus-building through a group process clearly has its shortcomings. But some experts on the democratic process see it as an effective means to an end. "Setting an effective group process, we think, is really the only way to move things forward," said Maya Lampson, director of the Leadership New York program at the Coro New York Leadership Center. Coro is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that trains people to be effective, ethical leaders in a Democratic system. "Having a consensus decision-making process allows for inclusivity and also more of a sense of buy-in and ownership," Lampson said, "so when decisions do get made, things can move forward a little more rapidly." She has high hopes that the Occupy Wall Street movement will effect change in some way. Marty Linsky does not. "Because they are committed to this process, what they agree on is becoming more and more abstract," the co-founder of Cambridge Leadership Associates said. His company is often called to help organizations turn a bunch of good ideas and recommendations into action with a positive outcome. He doesn't see that happening with Occupy Wall Street. "I think that's the danger of this kind of process," Linsky said. "If we say we're going to operate by consensus, which is everybody has to agree, well, the only way you can get everybody to agree when people have different agendas is to agree on something that is so ethereal as to be meaningless." Linsky warns that this addiction to a process in which everybody has a voice could spell the demise for Occupy Wall Street. His advice to people taking part in the demonstrations is to run for office, work for a campaign and learn from the tea party. "Tea party folks understood that if they were actually going to create change as opposed to just complain ... they had to figure out a way to influence directly the decisions that people made." One thing Linsky thinks the Occupy Wall Street movement has working in its favor is that it's constantly growing. "These folks -- like the tea party people -- have numbers," he said, "and numbers in a Democratic setting are an incredibly important resource and a powerful counterweight to dollars." In order for that to be an effective tool in achieving whatever it is the Occupy Wall Street movement eventually decides to do, Linsky said someone is going to have to assume leadership. "If someone were to actually try to shape and form that movement into something that actually might effect change, that person is going to annoy a lot of those people in Zuccotti Park." Linsky said anyone in a leadership role within the movement will automatically make enemies because he or she will have to put some people's agendas on hold. The leadership role is starting to be filled, not by one person but two dozen people. They call themselves the Demands Committee. They're meeting regularly in New York to discuss possible actionable demands: a list they can present to the entire movement. This being a group process, they say the eventual list will be adopted only if it is approved by more than two-thirds of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators. Part of complete coverage on</text>

<title>Occupy Wall Street returns with 'sleepful protest' - CNN.com</title>
<text>Occupy Wall Street returns with 'sleepful protest' By Steve Kastenbaum, CNN updated 11:06 AM EDT, Wed April 18, 2012 Occupy Wall Street supporters have moved their protests to sidewalks. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The Occupy Wall Street movement is ramping up its activities In New York, protesters have moved to a sidewalk near the Stock Exchange Protesters plan for May 1 to be their first large-scale demonstration of the year New York CNN -- In the spirit of spring rebirth, the Occupy movement is ramping up activities as warm weather blankets the country. But while the season is typified by a reawakening of life outdoors, demonstrators are using sleep to get their points across. They call it "sleepful protest." The sleeping bags started appearing on the corner of Wall and Broad streets across from the New York Stock Exchange on April 9. A civil rights attorney sympathetic to the Occupy movement provided the legal justification for the move in the form of a court ruling from 2000. A federal district court judge said people can sleep on sidewalks as a form of political expression as long as they take up no more than half of the sidewalk and don't block any doors. Occupy organizers declared a month ago that the movement would be planning a comeback in the spring and summer. Some city and state governments, armed with new ordinances aimed at the Occupy movements, are ready to prevent demonstrators from re-establishing encampments. For the past few nights, dozens of Occupy Wall Street protesters have slept on a patch of concrete a stone's throw away from the traders and stock brokers who are the targets of their message. "The goal here is to not violate the law and not give the police a reason to move the group," said Ted Schulman, who has taken part in Occupy demonstrations for several months. Every morning, they talk about income inequality and the role of big money in politics as commuters pass by on their way to jobs in the Financial District. Most people who work in the area seem indifferent. "They just don't understand how things work," said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial. "They have fantasy ideas. But, they're entitled to their opinions." While police have occasionally forced the protesters to move so the sidewalk could be cleaned, and a few have been arrested, Occupy protester Lauren DiGioia is not deterred. "We're not afraid anymore. I mean, we've been through so much. All of us have been to jail," said DiGioia, a 27-year-old with hair dyed neon blue. "We know we're doing the right thing." What are Occupiers really fighting for CNN Explains: The Occupy movement So-called sleepful protests have popped up elsewhere in the country with varying degrees of success. In Washington, police have been less accommodating, while in Los Angeles, protesters have taken to sleeping outside Bank of America branches, a frequent target of the Occupy movement. Similar sidewalk sleep-ins are taking place in Boston and Atlanta. The protesters on Wall Street don't expect their sleep-in to grow into an encampment like the one that became home to hundreds of people at nearby Zuccotti Park. "I view this as the pre-campaign. I certainly doubt that this will still be here May 1st when the big rallies start," Schulman said. "My guess is by that point, they'll have taken control of this space again." Occupy organizers are calling for large-scale demonstrations across the country on May 1 in conjunction with the labor movement's International Workers Day. Part of complete coverage on</text>

<title>Occupying Wall Street, demanding accountability - CNN.com</title>
<text>Occupying Wall Street, demanding accountability By Alan Silverleib, CNN updated 5:53 AM EDT, Tue October 4, 2011 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Occupy Wall Street is a protest movement covering a range of issues, with no clear leadership Many of the protesters are upset with growing wealth divide in the United States Nobody's being held accountable, one protester complains It's too soon to clearly label the movement, Stanford sociologist Susan Olzak says Editor's note: Are you participating in the protests Share your photos and video with CNN iReport. CNN -- Hero Vincent has a dream: to see the titans of Wall Street trade their palatial office suites for a row of dank prison cells. The crime Theft. Stealing billion-dollar, taxpayer-funded bailouts. Getting rich on your dime while you struggle to make ends meet. And if you're tired of standing by while the rich get richer and the middle class crumbles, he has a suggestion: Take it to the streets. Vincent, 21 and unemployed, has suddenly become one of several unofficial spokesmen for Occupy Wall Street, a leaderless protest movement made largely of twenty-somethings upset with the state of the economy, the state of the war in Afghanistan, the state of the environment, and the state of America and the world in general. If that sounds vague, it's meant to be. In less than three weeks, the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected Americans. And at a time when an overwhelming majority of Americans say the country's on the wrong track, there's no shortage of new potential recruits. Photos: 'Occupy Wall Street' protests On Saturday, more than 700 protesters were arrested for blocking the Brooklyn Bridge. A splinter group called Occupy Chicago touted a "huge afternoon march." In Boston, 34 groups -- unions and other organizations focused on everything from foreclosure prevention to climate change -- marched for "an economy that works for all of us," according to one website. Over on the West Coast, Occupy Los Angeles kicked off with a march to City Hall. In Seattle, demonstrators touted "a leaderless resistance movement with people of many colors and genders." Wall Street protests just inconvenience 'Occupy Wall Street' protests spread What does Occupy Wall Street stand for On Monday, a live video feed from Occupy Wall Street was featured at the start of a three-day conference of progressive leaders in Washington. What does it all mean "We're here for different reasons," said Vincent, whose father is also unemployed and recently went through a home foreclosure. "But at the end of the day, it all boils down to one thing, and that's accountability. We want accountability for the connection between Wall Street and the politicians." "Something has to change," he told CNN. "We're out here because we're tired of what's been going on." Giles Clarke, a 46-year-old freelance photographer and father of two, echoes Vincent's call for greater accountability. "People have simply had enough," Clarke said. "We're living in an age where the inequality between high-end Wall Street and the rest of us is simply a gap that has become too big. Millions of people have lost their jobs. Millions of people have lost their homes." There's been, Clarke said, "way too much cloak-and-dagger activity within the corridors of Wall Street" in recent years. "This is about raising awareness and a change of political discourse." The average person, according to Vincent, "is just fed up because there's no more middle class. The margin between us and the employers is so great now. Where will we be in a couple of years" Does he actually want to occupy Wall Street and shut it down "We want to educate people," Vincent said. But "if Wall Street actually shuts down, we'll be happy about it." The movement "feels like something that will ultimately spread like the Arab spring," said Egberto Willies, a CNN iReporter in Washington. "I call it the American autumn." Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in U.S. history during various times characterized by growing economic stress. That said, it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda, said Susan Olzak, a Stanford University sociology professor. "It's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history," Olzak told CNN. "Clearer goals could eventually emerge, but there's no guarantee." "Many movements fizzle out. Others become more organized," she said. But "I think we run a risk by taking a snapshot at any one point in time, and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot. The only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time." If Vincent, Willies and Clarke have their way, there will be plenty of time for this movement to continue to grow and evolve. Some observers question if it could become a liberal counterweight to the conservative populism of the tea party. For his part, Clarke predicts the movement will go international in the next few months. "Let's get talking," he urged. "Let's have some of these issues looked at."

<title>Why Occupy May Day fizzled - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why Occupy May Day fizzled By Amitai Etzioni, Special to CNN updated 2:28 PM EDT, Thu August 16, 2012 Occupy Wall Street participants stage a march as part of May Day celebrations in New York STORY HIGHLIGHTS Amitai Etzioni says Occupy Wall Street's May Day protests made little splash He says general strike sometimes effective in history. But Occupy's goals too vague He says it's no focused tea party, which has affected policy, helped elect officials Etzioni: Occupy has contributed a slogan, but where's its real influence on policy Editor's note: Amitai Etzioni is professor of international relations and director of the Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies at George Washington University. CNN -- Occupy Wall Street called on the masses to skip work and school on May 1, and to close their wallets. All this was supposed to amount to a general strike, if not an American Spring. Some even talked about bringing down capitalism. But the small demonstrations in many American cities and in other cities across the world had little effect. Rush hour on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, supposed to be a major center of protest, flowed. In Los Angeles, two blocks were closed by the authorities in anticipation of possible disruptions. Reports were that protesters in New York did not shut down traffic, as they planned to do. Some 2,000 demonstrated in Athens, and 7,000 next to a Greek factory, one of the most poorly attended demonstrations in the recent experience of this troubled land. Workers marched in several other cities across the world, as they do on every May 1. Historically, general strikes were considered a powerful tool, meant to demonstrate the power of the people often organized labor, able at least to gum up the working of major segments of the economy. In France, general strikes were used to force the government to make significant concessions. For instance, the 2006 demonstrations over the controversial CPE or contrat première embauche, first employment contract, which would have made it easier for employers to fire young workers lasted two months before President Jacques Chirac scrapped the legislation. Amitai Etzioni In the United States, the last general strike took place in 1946. While some 100,000 workers from 142 unions participated, it did not lead to concessions by the powers that be, let alone bring down anything. This time If the past is any predictor of the future, the deliberately nonhierarchical Occupy Wall Street movement, with its fuzzy messages and vague goals, is not going to leave a major mark. Seattle 'Occupy May Day' gets ugly CNN Explains: The Occupy movement Occupy May Day "fizzled" Not so fast, say iReporters Some observers saw, at least initially, "an irresistible symmetry" between Occupy Wall Street and the tea party, despite some clear differences. An article in TIME described Occupy Wall Street as a "new outpouring of protest ... driven by the same fuel that gave fire to the tea party." In an October 2011 interview, President Obama said, "I understand the frustrations being expressed in those protests. In some ways, they're not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the tea party." The comparison is informative, but in a rather different way. It highlights how weak the left is and how strong the right is in American politics. The tea party has a sharply edged message and has used its considerable following to elect public officials, who in turn have affected public policy. For instance, they prevented the GOP leadership from compromising with Obama on raising taxes in exchange for cutting entitlements and government outlays. And the tea party put deficit reduction on the top of the political agenda. Speaking about the August 2011 deficit deal, Sen. John McCain said, "I don't think without the tea party we would have had an agreement." There is little in Occupy Wall Street's record that compares to these political victories. Defenders of Occupy Wall Street may well argue that it was never meant to be a political power, but rather a cultural force, more like the counterculture of the '60s than a new civil rights movement. Jonathan Schell argues that "it was not a new set of policy ideas that was being born — the world was already overloaded with these, unacted upon — but a new spirit. ..." But the cultural messages Occupy Wall Street carries, say, environmental responsibility or divorce from capitalism, are far from clear. And while the counterculture could thrive briefly in an age in which America was well-heeled, the message of opting out of the prevailing system does not seem to bring out the masses who seek employment, to avoid foreclosure, or simply to make ends meet. Arguably the greatest achievement attributed to Occupy Wall Street is that it put inequality on the agenda of American politics, with its most memorable slogan: "We are the 99%." Writing in The New York Times, Brian Stelter described this line as a new "national shorthand" for the vast economic disparities facing the United States, noting that "whatever the long-term effects of the Occupy movement, protesters have succeeded in implanting 'We are the 99%'...into the cultural and political lexicon." Even an article in the conservative Weekly Standard declared Occupy Wall Street has changed the public discourse, making inequality the topic of the day. There is no question that inequality has been rising in the United States and that it raises numerous issues concerning what is a fair distribution of income and wealth, what taxes we ought to raise, and how to prevent those who acquire great economic power from also gaining excessive political power through campaign contributions. I share these social justice concerns. However, I cannot help but note that there is a world of difference between putting something on the front pages of the newspapers for a few weeks and achieving changes in laws and, above all, in the distribution of wealth. Given that Occupy Wall Street has not advocated any specific ways to reduce inequality and does not have the political organization to back up such an agenda, either others will have to find ways to curb inequality or we will see little progress on this front in the great budget battles to come shortly after the 2012 election. Most assuredly, a general strike that fizzles will not serve the cause of reducing inequality, or even help Occupy Wall Street find its sea legs. Occupy Wall Street will have more opportunities to show that it did not flame out; however, it had better come up with a more cogent strategy, or it will soon be one more wasted force, one more protest movement that vented feelings but engendered precious little real social change.

<text>Occupy Oakland demonstrations, arrests inject new life into movement By Chelsea J. Carter, CNN updated 4:50 PM EST, Mon January 30, 2012 Oakland police clashed with Occupy Oakland protesters on Saturday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Oakland City Hall reopens NEW: Protesters vow to stand their ground at Occupy DC camp Mass arrests in Oakland among largest in city history, police say Arrests are reported in New York, Philadelphia and Tampa Are the Occupy protests taking place where you live Let us know . CNN -- Oakland City Hall reopened Monday after municipal employees worked to clean up damage they said was caused over the weekend by Occupy protesters, about 400 of whom were arrested following clashes with police in the Northern California city. Marvine White was one such worker, called in over the weekend to help scrub graffiti and vacuum floors, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. "This is not protesting. This is something else. When you protest, you protest. This is madness here," White said. The mass arrests, described by police as the largest in city history, appear to have injected new life into the Occupy movement as protesters in a number of American and European cities took to the streets Sunday to express their solidarity with the Occupy Oakland group. "The Occupy movement will respond, as we have always responded: With an overwhelming show of collective resistance," Occupy Wall Street said in a statement posted on its website. Windows broken, flags burned in Oakland City Hall Occupy Oakland is part of a larger movement that began last year on New York's Wall Street and quickly spread across the globe. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme remained the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. From Philadelphia to Des Moines, Iowa, there were reports of Occupy protesters taking to the streets in mostly non-violent demonstrations. Oakland police clash with protesters Occupy Atlanta rallies to protect home Twelve people were arrested in New York during an Occupy Wall Street protest that saw the group march from Gramercy Park to Tompkins Square Park, police said. Charges and details about the arrests were not immediately made available. In Tampa, Florida, several protesters were arrested for blocking traffic, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. In Philadelphia, police reported several hundred protesters blocked traffic near City Hall and attempted to cut down a fence near an area park where Occupy protesters were recently evicted from camping out. Two protesters were arrested, according to CNN affiliate WPVI . Overseas, Occupy protests were held outside U.S. consulates in Melbourne and Toronto, while statements of solidarity were issued by Occupy groups in Olso, Norway, and in Vancouver, British Columbia, according to Twitter and website posts late Sunday. Much of the news stemming from the Occupy movement in recent weeks has focused on government efforts to relocate the protest groups, many of whom had taken up residence in city parks and plazas. In Washington, D.C., the National Park Service gave Occupy protesters a deadline to end what it called "sleeping activity" at two longstanding camps established by demonstrators in the nation's capital. U.S. Park Police began enforcing the ban Monday, with Occupy protesters at one site defiantly huddling under a large blue tarp that they dubbed the "tent of dreams." Park service to crack down on Occupy DC camps Park police used a stun gun to apprehend one demonstrator, who tore down park service notices warning protesters of the Monday deadline. But none of the weekend activities rose to the level of violence witnessed in Oakland, where protesters on Saturday clashed with police after they were prevented from taking over a long-vacant auditorium in the heart of downtown. Protesters and police traded allegations over who was to blame for the violence that saw demonstrators throw rocks and bottles at police, who it turn fired bean bag rounds, tear gas and smoke grenades at the group. Oakland Police Officer Johnna Watson described what transpired as "one of the largest mass arrests that we have seen in the city." The charges ranged from failure to disperse to vandalism, Watson said. The city of about 420,000, located across the bay from San Francisco, has a long and sometimes violent history of activism dating back to the mid-1960s with the founding of the militant Black Panther Party and later for its anti-war protests. Oakland has been a flash point of the Occupy movement since October, when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown. One demonstrator, an Iraq war veteran, suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile, according to a veteran's group. Police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers. In November, violence broke out again in Oakland when police shuttered an Occupy camp at an area park. Twice, protesters have forced the shut down of the Port of Oakland. But Saturday marked a new chapter in the Oakland Occupy movement when the group attempted to take over the long-vacant Henry Kaiser Convention Center to use as a hub. The group said it was necessary, in part because "since November, the city of Oakland and its police force have made it impossible for us to meet, to serve food and to provide a place for people to stay." The effort turned violent when police turned the group back, alleging the protesters were damaging construction equipment and fences near the convention center. By nightfall, the protesters stormed a YMCA and later broke into City Hall, police and city officials said. Protesters have decried the allegations, saying they entered the buildings through open doors. But Mayor Jean Quan told reporters that police have video showing protesters using a crowbar, or something similar to it, to pry open an emergency door to enter City Hall. Quan took reporters through City Hall on Sunday, pointing to walls where graffiti had already been painted over and other areas of garbage, vandalism and destruction that she said had been left by protesters. The mayor said there were no firm estimates as to how much damage had been caused, noting that workers had already painted over some "obscene" graffiti and that clean-up efforts would continue. Meanwhile, Occupy Oakland put out a call for financial aid to help some of those arrested make bail. "Our bail funds have been dwindling significantly as a result of the police backlash against occupy Oakland in the last month. If you are able, please donate," the group said.

<title>Tumblr becomes platform for Occupy Wall Street debate - CNN.com</title>
<text>Tumblr becomes platform for Occupy Wall Street debate By John D. Sutter, CNN updated 11:44 AM EDT, Wed October 12, 2011 | Filed under: Web STORY HIGHLIGHTS "We Are the 99 Percent" blog gains popularity on Tumblr People post messages about economic hardship on the site A rival, conservative site called "We are the 53%" launched That Tumblr page says it represents Americans who pay federal income taxes CNN -- The blogging platform Tumblr -- which sits somewhere between Twitter and WordPress on the social media spectrum -- has become one of the more interesting places to watch the debate about the Occupy Wall Street protests unfold. On the Tumblr site " We Are the 99 Percen t," people who sympathize with the New York-based protest movement are telling first-person stories of hardship and unemployment. Each post features a photo of its author holding up a paper sign that tells a bit of the person's story and says "We Are the 99 Percent," a reference to the protestors' concern that the top 1% of Americans command much of the country's wealth and power , leaving the rest to struggle. "We are getting kicked out of our homes. We are forced to choose between groceries and rent. We are denied quality medical care. We are suffering from environmental pollution. We are working long hours for little pay and no rights, if we're working at all," a blog introduction says. "We are getting nothing while the other 1 percent is getting everything. We are the 99 percent." Here's one post from Tuesday: "My mom worked on Wall Street for almost 30 years. In 2008, when the market crashed, the company she worked for shut down. The CEOs were taken care of, but all the loyal workers were left with nothing. My mom still hasn't found work. I am the 99 percent." And another: "I'm a small business owner. I just bought new work computers so my colleague and I can do our jobs. Now, I have no money for food for the next 3 days next paycheck. I'm always one check away from eviction. I'm one of the 'lucky ones.'" On Tuesday night there were 77 pages filled with similar stories, and about a half-dozen posts on each page. As attention for that Tumblr page grew, a competing blog with a more conservative ideology came into being. The conservative " We are the 53% " Tumblr page says it represents the 53% of Americans who must pay federal income tax Most people who make less than $30,000 per year pay no major federal income taxes, according to a 2009 report from the non-partisan Tax Policy Center, as CNNMoney reports. The assumption is that Occupy Wall Street protestors and sympathizers on the "We Are the 99 Percent" site don't pay taxes. "I work 3 jobs. I have a house I can't sell. My family insurance costs are outrageous. But I don't blame Wall Street. Shut it up you whiners. I am the 53% subsidizing you so you can hang out on Wall Street and complain," the introductory post on October 5 says. The 53% blog was created by Erick Erickson, who also is an editor at the conservative site RedState.com, according to the Washington Post . Erikson also is an occasional commentator for CNN. The conservative Tumblr blog has six pages of posts, compared to 77 on the site sympathizing with Occupy Wall Street. "I would love to hang out in in sic the park for a couple of weeks protesting the entitlement generation and radical egalitarianism, but I have a job to go to. Go figure," another post says. Tumblr has become the site of choice for people organizing the Occupy Wall Street movement, which started in New York and has spread to many other cities in the United States, writes Jesse Emspak for DiscoveryNews . "The site has been a force behind the Occupy Wall Street protests, growing the number of demonstrations from just dozens of people in late September to thousands," he says. At The Atlantic, Rebecca Rosen says the "We Are the 99 Percent" Tumblr page is the digital equivalent of bathroom stall graffiti -- "allowing you to bear something private and maybe find someone else carrying around the same weight." Along with the It Gets Better Project and PostSecret , the Tumblr account is part of an increasingly important medium called the "collaborative confessional," she says. "This is self-service history, with no curator and no narrator. Some of the stories call out for follow-up questions, but there is no one to ask them," Rosen writes. "The results are raw and rough, but demonstrate that, with or without a Terkel, the power of personal narrative, whether on the radio, in a book, on YouTube, or on a Tumblr, can cut through the noise and cynicism of punditry and give shape and texture to our national story."

<title>Idaho challenges national health care proposal; more states may follow - CNN.com</title>
<text>Idaho challenges national health care proposal; more states may follow From Dugald McConnell, CNN Idaho passes law challenging federal mandate that penalizes people who want to opt out 22 additional states have seen proposals of opposition introduced Legal analysts say federal law would supersede any state laws written to block them Florida attorney general sends letters to 49 colleagues seeking to mount legal challenge RELATED TOPICS Idaho Washington CNN -- Idaho on Wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of President Obama's health care proposal. The Idaho Health Care Freedom Act says in part, "every person within the state of Idaho is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty." Gov. C.L. "Butch" Otter, a Republican, said Wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are "treated as an individual, rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates." Several other states may follow suit. The governor of Virginia is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week, and according to American Legislative Exchange Council, similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee. While such bills have recently failed in six states, 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced. These state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that Democrats are trying to pass, which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty. Video: Health care battle Several legal analysts said if Congress enacts a national health care law, it would supersede any state laws written to block them. "I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can't trump federal law with state law," said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School. "But what they get out of it is symbolic effect. They're sending a message to the federal politicians that they don't like the health care mandate." Such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation. Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican, on Tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general, asking them to join him "in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges, immediately upon the legislation becoming law." States have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care. Five states have passed a Firearms Freedom Act, according to firearmsfreedomact.com, including Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah. The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in-state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority, because the guns never crossed state lines. A number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state's National Guard forces are deployed overseas, according to the 10th Amendment Center, which advocates for states' rights. While such laws may face an uphill path in court, supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion, which can still have impact. They point to last year's announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana, after 14 states passed laws to allow its use. While federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana, Attorney General Eric Holder said in October that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users wouldn't be a priority. He said the Justice Department would instead "effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers, while taking into account state and local laws." CNN's Brian Todd and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

Romney might work Seven in 10 people in the state support the program, expert says Observers say the program doesn't control rising health care costs By Jim Acosta and Ed Hornick CNN CNN -- If Washington wants health care reform with bipartisan support, experts say consider what former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney accomplished as governor in Democratic Massachusetts. Mitt Romney says the president must have bipartisanship in order to get quality health care reform. "You don't have to have a public option," Romney said. "You don't have to have the government getting into the insurance business to make it work." Three years after enacting its own version of reform, Massachusetts now has near-universal coverage. Taxpayer watchdogs say it's affordable. "There is this widespread assumption, that is treated as fact, that it's breaking the bank in Massachusetts ... it's not breaking the bank at all." said Michael Widmer of Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. And health care experts say it's popular. "Seven in 10 people in the state support the program, and no more than one in 10 would repeal it." said Robert Blendon with the Harvard University School of Public Health. Unlike Democratic proposals that would give Americans the choice of joining a government-run health care plan, Massachusetts has no public option. Instead, people in the state are required to buy private insurance, and the poor get subsidies. The reform created the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, which is similar to a health insurance exchange. Don't Miss In Depth: Health care in America Nicknamed "Connector," its purpose, according to the state, is to connect individuals and small businesses statewide to affordable insurance plans. The program reviews "existing health insurance coverage plans in the marketplace" and gives "certain plans the Connector 'seal of approval.' Plans offered through the Connector will not be subject to minimum contribution and participation rules," according to the state government's Web site. And under the 2006 legislation, there are several requirements for insurance companies. According to Brian Rosman of Health Care for All, a nonprofit based in Massachusetts, the requirements include: Minimum benefits, such as preventive care, mental health care and hospitalization A ban on gender discrimination Limits on total out-of-pocket costs A prohibition on pre-existing conditions as a qualifier for health coverage No medical underwriting, so insurers can't ask an individual about his or her health status in order to determine coverage Limits on age restrictions, which means what is charged for an older individual cannot be more than double what is charged the youngest. Analysts say "Romney care" is basically "Obama care" minus the public option. Watch more on Romney's program » When asked if he'd support Obama's health care reform plan if it doesn't include a public option, Romney said that it "depends on what's in the rest of the bill." The Massachusetts model, however, does have its problems. Experts say it doesn't control rising health care costs -- something Romney insisted must be tackled on a national level. Michael Tanner, the director of health and welfare studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the Romney care program plan costs taxpayers a "great deal of money." "Originally, the plan was projected to cost $1.8 billion this year. Now it is expected to exceed those estimates by $150 million," he said in 2008. "Over the next 10 years, projections suggest that Romney Care will cost about $2 billion more than was budgeted." He added: "And the cost to Massachusetts taxpayers could be even higher because new federal rules could deprive the state of $100 million per year in Medicaid money that the state planned to use to help finance the program." At a GOP presidential debate at Reagan Library in June 2008, Romney defended his program. "I'm the only one that got the job done. I got health insurance for all our citizens. We had 460,000 people without insurance. We got 300 of them -- 300,000 of them -- signed up for insurance now. I'm proud of what we accomplished," he said at the time. Meanwhile, Romney says Democrats have only themselves to blame for those rowdy town hall meetings that have sometimes been reduced to shouting matches and even violence. "I think any time you're dealing with people's health care and their ability to choose their doctor, you're going to find people responding very emotionally," he said. As for former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's now debunked claim that reform would lead to so-called "death panels," Romney said "I'm not going to tell people what they can and cannot talk about." Still, Romney does warn the president that bipartisanship is the only road to health care reform. "I think the right process for the president to pursue on a subject that is so emotional, so important to all Americans, is to go through the lengthy process of working on a bipartisan basis," he said. "He promised that." Democratic sources said Tuesday that the White House might resort to passing a Democratic-only bill without bipartisan support. The White House later said Wednesday that the president was hopeful bipartisan talks would continue if Republicans continue to help Democrats devise a comprehensive plan. Democrats, however, may run into problems. A Quinnipiac University poll shows the American public is wary of a Democratic-only bill. When asked if that's the right approach, 59 percent said they were opposed, while 36 percent said yes. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. But it's not all good news for Republicans. A new NBC News poll shows only 21 percent approve of the Republican Party's handling of health care, while 62 percent disapprove. In contrast, 41 percent approve of Obama's handling of the issue, while 47 percent disapprove. The NBC News poll was conducted August 15-17, with 805 adults questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.</text>

<title>What the Supreme Court ruled on health care 'tax' - CNN.com</title>
<text>The Supreme Court rejected arguments that the individual mandate involves a "penalty" The mandate "looks like a tax in many respects," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote The Obama administration argued that it's a penalty but also could be viewed as a tax The court said the Anti-Injunction Act does not apply CNN -- In its ruling last week on the national health care law, the Supreme Court found that penalties the law places on people who don't buy health insurance count as a tax protected by the Constitution. The Obama administration had argued that the fees should be considered a penalty. But the government also argued that the individual mandate can be viewed as constitutional under Congress' powers of taxation. The high court rejected the "penalty" argument. "The payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penalties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by the Internal Revenue Service through the normal means of taxation," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the decision. The court noted that the law calls for no other punishments for refusal to buy health insurance. Romney, Obama's tax vs. penalty problem Is health care mandate a tax... or not Obama said mandate isn't tax in 2009 "Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance," the decision said, citing figures from the Congressional Budget Office. "We would expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful." What the ruling means to you But on the taxation argument, the court agreed. The Constitution allows Congress to tax and spend, giving the federal government "considerable influence even in areas where it cannot directly regulate," the decision said. The mandate "looks like a tax in many respects," Roberts wrote. The money is to be paid by people when they file their tax returns and does not apply to those who pay no federal income taxes; the amount someone owes "is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing status," and the "requirement to pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by the IRS." The high court overturned a unanimous decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the mandate did not impose a tax. The Supreme Court also ruled that it could proceed with considering the constitutionality of the tax despite the Anti-Injunction Act, which dates back 145 years. The law said lawsuits can't be used to prevent taxing, only to get refunded for taxes already paid. The high court said whether something is a tax for the purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act is Congress' decision -- and since Congress designated the mandate as including a penalty rather than a tax, the law did not apply in this case. "It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress's choice of label on that question. That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress's constitutional power to tax." The court emphasized that it was not weighing in on whether the mandate is a good idea. "Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness," the decision said.

<title>Socialized healthcare: The 'untouchable' of UK politics - CNN.com</title>
<text>Socialized healthcare: The 'untouchable' of UK politics By Paul Armstrong, CNN On average the NHS deals with one million patients every 36 hours, or 463 people a minute. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Launched in 1948, NHS provides healthcare regardless of wealth It employs more than 1.7 million people, with annual budget of more than $160B NHS is centrally-funded through national taxation Republicans in U.S. label NHS as "socialized" healthcare system which risks patients' lives London, England CNN -- After weeks of feverish election campaigning, Britain's political parties have fought over every issue, from the economy to the country's nuclear deterrent, with one exception: the National Health Service. To many Republican politicians in the United States, a publicly-funded national health system like the NHS is the embodiment of austere, Soviet-era style medical care, but in the UK it is viewed as sacrosanct. Launched in 1948 by a left-wing Labour government, the NHS was created out of a long-held ideal that everyone should have access to good healthcare regardless of wealth. More than half a century on and millions of Britons still enjoy free medical care, from routine consultations on coughs and colds to open heart surgery, at the point of use. NHS FACTS * The NHS employs more than 1.7 million people across Britain, including: - 120,000 hospital doctors - 40,000 community doctors - 400,000 nurses * On average the NHS deals with one million patients every 36 hours -- or 463 people a minute * Each week, 700,000 people will visit an NHS dentist * Each week, 3,000 people will have a heart operation * Each GP in the nation's 10,000-plus practices sees an average of 140 patients a week Source: NHS Over the years it can boast pioneering breakthroughs and public health campaigns, from Britain's first heart transplant in 1968, to the first major Aids awareness drive in the 1980s. One of its most ambitious projects was the 1988 breast screening program, providing free mammograms to reduce breast cancer in women over 50. The scale of the NHS is vast. Only the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the U.S. Wal-Mart supermarket chain and Indian Railways directly employ more people, it claims. But the cost of maintaining an extensive healthcare system is an increasing burden on national coffers, as Britain's aging population needs more treatment. Centrally-funded through taxation, pressure to respond to growing demand has seen record levels of investment in the past decade. According to Britain's Department of Health, the current annual NHS budget is $162 billion -- almost 18 percent of total public expenditure. Despite massive investment in aging infrastructure and services, the current Labour government is accused by political rivals of mismanaging major projects such as the computerization of all NHS records. UK election coverage The government has also tackled other issues such as treatment waiting lists and a "post-code lottery" system in which decisions about who gets life-saving drugs are based on the budget of local health authorities. Non-partisan health think tank, the King's Fund, found wide geographical variations in cancer treatment budgets for example. Nevertheless opposition Conservative leader David Cameron seems as committed to the NHS as Labour, despite his party's ideological disposition to the private sector. Video: Shopping for cheap surgery Video: Candidates clash over elderly benefits He recently acknowledged its value on his party's Web site. "Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS -- including my own family," he said. "One of the wonderful things about living in this country is that the moment you're injured or fall ill -- no matter who you are, where you are from, or how much money you've got -- you know that the NHS will look after you." Cameron's words were reinforced by the party's election manifesto, in which it calls itself "the party of the NHS" and pledges "never to change at the idea at its heart that healthcare in this country is free at the point of use and available to everyone based on need and not ability to pay." This is a major shift away from previous Conservative leaders. Margaret Thatcher encouraged people to use private medical services and proposed tax breaks for private health insurance in the 1980s. The Liberal Democrats are equally effusive about the need to protect key parts of the NHS, such as cancer treatment and maternity care, but have refused to rule out future cuts. Ruth Thorlby, a research fellow at the King's Fund, told CNN that all the major parties appreciate the NHS strikes an emotive chord with the public and that it is a price worth paying. She said: "We have this extraordinary political consensus now that the funding structure of the NHS is sound. Differences over individual issues, such as the funding for the care of the elderly or expensive drug treatment, will be debated after the election." "Millions of people are grateful for the care they have received from the NHS. --David Cameron</text>

<text>Health Care Reform Editor's note: Kristi C. Guillory is an attorney, health policy consultant and freelance writer. She was a presidential management fellow at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and served as a senior policy analyst and assistant counsel with The Council of State Governments. Alexandria, Virginia CNN -- The tiny conference room was cold. My heart was beating fast. I was scared to sign the papers and I tried to quell my unremitting hot stream of tears. I'd thought, as an attorney, that legal documents would never scare me. But, this was no ordinary piece of paper. This was Daddy's DNR order. A DNR, or do not resuscitate order, is a legal document that ensures that resuscitation efforts will not be attempted if someone suffers a cardiac or respiratory arrest. End-of-life, or advance care planning, is a subject that far too many families avoid discussing until it's too late. My father's cancer battle culminated last July when he spent the last week of his life in the hospital. That time by my father's side was the hardest week of my life, but my mother and I were "lucky." Lucky, because we knew what my father's wishes were at the end of his life and we had a legal document in place that reflected his wishes. Advance directives provide instruction for your family and physician about the types of treatment you want at the end of your life. Sadly, most Americans don't have them. A 2003 report by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research found that less than 50 percent of terminally ill patients studied had an advance care directive in their medical record. Of those who had directives, between 65 and 76 percent of their physicians were not aware it existed. End-of-life planning, unfortunately, has emerged as a hot button political issue. In 2009, House Democrats included a provision in the health care reform bill that would have allowed Medicare to reimburse doctors for end-of-life discussions. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin derided the proposal as "Obama's death panel," falsely asserting that the government would act as arbiter on who would receive health care. Then-Minority Leader John Boehner claimed that encouraging these discussions would be a step toward "government-sponsored euthanasia." Ultimately, the provision ignited such intense vitriol that congressional leaders dropped the provision from the final bill that was signed by President Obama. This issue emerged again briefly this year. On January 4, the Obama administration withdrew a Medicare regulation that would have reimbursed physicians for discussing end-of-life options with patients during their annual checkups. It was abruptly withdrawn less than three days after the regulations were to become final. The White House argued that the public should have had more time to comment on the proposal and suggested that the provision should have been part of another proposed rule instead. Many of the arguments against advance-care planning, however, lack merit. The point of the provision was to foster conversation about dying between doctors and patients as well as informed decision making. In an October 2008 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that patients who had these discussions were more likely to accept their prognosis and preferred to receive comfort care, rather than aggressive life-extending therapies. Many choose hospice care, which treats the entire person, both medically and spiritually. Researchers found that patients' quality of life was poorest when they underwent aggressive treatments in the last week of their lives, which often happens when other options aren't discussed. Tale of sportscaster facing death provokes spiritual outpouring It is a shame that the federal government isn't making advance care planning easier by enacting legislation on this issue. When the federal government doesn't act on an issue, the states are usually the harbingers of change. In 2008, California became the first state to provide terminally ill patients with full disclosure and counseling. Under the Patients' Right to Know Act, at a patient's request, a physician must provide information about issues such as palliative care, hospice care, and refusal or withdrawal of life-prolonging treatments. In February 2011, the New York Palliative Care Information Act took effect. The bill provides that if a patient has a terminal illness, the patient's doctor or nurse practitioner is required to offer the patient information on choices. While leadership at the state level should be applauded, a national approach is still needed. April 16 is National Health Care Decisions Day -- an invaluable opportunity for families across America to begin to make informed health-care decisions or revisit the decisions that have been made. And, imparting a lesson learned from my recent experience, I implore everyone to start the process of advance-care planning for yourself. Figure out what you want, document your wishes, inform your loved ones and urge them to do the same. My father was known for his gift of gab, but he knew the limits of chatter and often gave me the sage advice, "Nothing hurts a duck more than its beak." To that advice, I would add that when it comes to discussing important issues like advance-care planning with your loved ones, not opening your beak can be just as harmful.

<title>Health care costs choking small businesses - CNN.com</title>
<text>Health care costs choking small businesses Story Highlights Auto shop owner Brian England worries costs could stop him from providing benefits Business owner David Guernsey says premiums increased 25 percent some years Guernsey and England agree the problem of ballooning costs must be fixed England wants to see a government health care plan emphasizing preventative care By Rachel Streitfeld CNN WASHINGTON CNN -- Maryland auto shop owner Brian England offers health care coverage to his 18 employees, including part-time staff. He calls it "the right thing to do," and besides, he knows taking care of his employees makes good business sense. Brian England, president of British American Auto Care, catches up on paperwork at the office. But every year his insurance premium costs rise another 10 or 20 percent, and England worries about the day when the fees will overwhelm him. After payroll and rent, health care is his largest business expense. "A business down the road could have their labor rate $5 cheaper than us because that's how much it costs for us to provide health care," England said, referring to the hourly rates his business and competitors might offer customers. Of the 46 million Americans living without health care, an outsized majority -- about 60 percent -- work for small businesses, according to the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute. Owners of those businesses say Congress needs to find a solution to an increasingly costly problem -- but they disagree about how to get it right. For England, shopping for policies and finding a way to afford to offer the benefits has become a yearly headache. "I'm in the business to do auto repair," England said. "I'm not in the business of trying to find out how to provide health coverage and how to get the right sort of plan.... And it's not easy." David Guernsey, who employs 170 people at his office supply business in Virginia, has struggled with the same rising costs to cover his employees -- some years, premiums have gone up 25 percent. His small company can't hope to compete with the benefits much larger companies can afford to offer their employees. Don't Miss King: Falling between health care cracks in Orlando "Their premiums are dramatically lower than ours are," Guernsey said. "They have leverage over the health care industry to be able to drive their premiums down, and yet we have to be able to compete with those folks. So it increasingly becomes a major competitive issue for us." Guernsey said that, occasionally, job seekers have complained that they're looking for a plan with more extensive coverage than Guernsey's provides, but he called the plan "pretty good, pretty competitive" and said no one has ever turned down a job offer in hopes of getting better benefits elsewhere. Both Guernsey and England agree the problem of ballooning costs must be fixed, and they expect the government to take some role in addressing health care costs. Watch business owners discuss the challenges they face Guernsey is skeptical of too much government involvement, and worries a mandate for employers to offer coverage could push up his premiums. "If the requirement were such that the kind of coverage we offer were dramatically different, dramatically more comprehensive, and the cost accordingly would go up significantly -- then that would be a problem," he said. Instead, he's hoping small businesses can pool their coverage with larger businesses in order to drive down prices. England, however, said he would like to see a government health care plan and an emphasis on preventative care. He said a government plan would force insurance companies to offer competitive rates. "I think once we get to doing that and everybody has insurance and we start to push it with the preventative care and community care, that's going to drive down the prices," England said. Taking preventative steps is, after all, something he's learned through his work. "We've preached preventative care to customers with cars for 31 years," England said. "So if we know it works with cars, we know it works with people, we all know that. It's just a matter of everybody getting onto the plan."</text>

<title>UK votes for action against ISIS - CNN.com</title>
<text>updated 12:29 PM EDT, Fri September 26, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Iraq war's chaotic aftermath left bitter political legacy in UK British lawmakers vote to launch airstrikes on ISIS militants Opinion polls suggest backing for action has grown in recent weeks Fear among lawmakers is that this intervention could be counter-productive London CNN -- More than a decade after the Iraq war, when one million people took to the streets to protest against intervention, British lawmakers have again been grappling with their consciences. In 2003, then-Prime Minister Tony Blair won a vote authorizing the use of force as part of a U.S.-led coalition to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but the war's chaotic aftermath left a bitter legacy. Last year British Prime Minister David Cameron lost a vote to bomb the Assad regime in Syria amid public opposition to another war. Political commentators said the failed vote by Washington's long-standing ally put a brake on President Barack Obama's plans to punish the Syrian leader for allegedly using chemical weapons on his own people. However, the task of Obama in building a coalition is likely to be made easier after Cameron easily won Friday's vote, by 524 votes to 43, authorizing the airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq. The opposition Labour Party supported the action against the Islamic militant group, despite doubts of some lawmakers on both sides of the House of Commons. Weaken ISIS, strengthen Al Qaeda PM: ISIS 'not Muslims, but monsters' Cameron responds to Haines' beheading Opinion polls also suggest backing for action has grown following the release of videos showing the beheadings of western hostages. In August opinion was evenly split 37-36%, according to one YouGov poll, but is now markedly more in favor 53-26% . Polling by Comres conducted before the death of British hostage David Haines also found similar backing for airstrikes: more than half of those who took part in the survey backed action -- a rise of 5% in a month. Cameron recalled Parliament after Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi requested British military support in its battle against ISIS. Fighter planes from France and the United States have already started bombing in Iraq, but unlike in those countries the convention in Britain is for lawmakers to vote in Parliament before action is taken. Veteran political commentator Robin Oakley said MPs were more in tune with the public than a year ago. "The degree of ISIS' brutality has changed a considerable number of minds. "People who previously had doubts are now convinced that there is no alternative but force. Voices will be raised: some MPs believe that bombing ISIS may radicalize the population in areas that it controls. Local people who never liked the al-Maliki government and who may have been suffering ISIS may now offer it their support." Oakley said it was the brutal videos that had likely won over lawmakers -- in contrast to the Syria vote. "Last year Labour couldn't support the action because MPs felt there was no conclusive evidence that al-Assad had used chemical weapons against his own people. "MPs will worry about 'mission creep' when there is no obvious aim apart from to eradicate ISIS. Military action may destroy the leaders but it cannot eradicate ideas -- so the fear among lawmakers is that this intervention could be counter-productive." Outside Parliament, there were also doubts about the military action. Protests took place in central London on Thursday, organized by Stop the War. The group's spokesman Ian Chamberlain said that while it was important to listen to public opinion, "once people start to see the results and start to reflect, I believe support will fall." "Public support for military interventions in Afghanistan collapsed after the results of the bombing became clear. Bombing increases sectarian hatred of the west, and it's obvious that military intervention doesn't work. You can't destroy terrorism by bombing infrastructure. It just brings more terrorism."

<title>Obama urges military action against Syria but will seek Congress' OK - CNN.com</title>
<text>Strike against Syria Obama backs it, but wants Congress to vote By Catherine E. Shoichet and Tom Watkins, CNN updated 10:40 PM EDT, Sat August 31, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Syrian official: Obama climbed to the top of the tree, "doesn't know how to get down" Obama sends a letter to the heads of the House and Senate Obama to seek congressional approval on military action against Syria Aim is to determine whether CW were used, not by whom, says U.N. spokesman Should the West intervene in Syria Tell us what you think. CNN -- It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria. Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons. The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force "to deter, disrupt, prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction." It's a step that is set to turn an international crisis into a fierce domestic political battle . There are key questions looming over the debate: What did U.N. weapons inspectors find in Syria What happens if Congress votes no And how will the Syrian government react In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to. "While I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective," he said. "We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual." Obama said top congressional leaders had agreed to schedule a debate when the body returns to Washington on September 9. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing over the matter on Tuesday, Sen. Robert Menendez said. Syrian crisis: Latest developments U.N. inspectors leave Syria Obama's remarks came shortly after U.N. inspectors left Syria, carrying evidence that will determine whether chemical weapons were used in an attack early last week in a Damascus suburb. "The aim of the game here, the mandate, is very clear -- and that is to ascertain whether chemical weapons were used -- and not by whom," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters on Saturday. But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis. Top U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels. British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons, but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors. The inspectors will share their findings with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Ban, who has said he wants to wait until the U.N. team's final report is completed before presenting it to the U.N. Security Council. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which nine of the inspectors belong to, said Saturday that it could take up to three weeks to analyze the evidence they collected. "It needs time to be able to analyze the information and the samples," Nesirky said. He noted that Ban has repeatedly said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria, and that "a military solution is not an option." Bergen: Syria is a problem from hell for the U.S. Obama: 'This menace must be confronted' Obama's senior advisers have debated the next steps to take, and the president's comments Saturday came amid mounting political pressure over the situation in Syria. Some U.S. lawmakers have called for immediate action while others warn of stepping into what could become a quagmire. Some global leaders have expressed support, but the British Parliament's vote against military action earlier this week was a blow to Obama's hopes of getting strong backing from key NATO allies. On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said. Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons earlier this month "is an assault on human dignity," the president said. A failure to respond with force, Obama argued, "could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted."</text>

<title>International leaders push for military intervention in Mali - CNN.com</title>
<text>International leaders push for military intervention in Mali By Faith Karimi and Katarina Hoije, CNN updated 2:51 PM EDT, Fri October 19, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS ECOWAS chairman calls for "immediate deployment of international troops" The meeting included officials from the EU, U.N. and West African states Mali was plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president Bamako, Mali CNN -- A rapid deployment of an international military force is essential to solving Mali's security crisis, regional and international leaders said after a meeting Friday in the nation's capital. "Mali needs a political transition through transparent elections within 12 months, functioning institutions and an immediate deployment of international troops," said Daniel Kablan, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson said his organization is ready to provide immediate support to aid national dialogue and assist in political negotiations. "We will immediately bring military planners and security sector advisers" to Bamako, the Malian capital, the secretary said. Rebels moving in across Mali Mali PM: We don't stand a chance Mali's cultural legacy threatened ECOWAS can provide military training, logistics and reinforcement of Mali's own forces, Kablan said. Leaders from the European Union, United Nations and Western African states met as al Qaeda-linked rebels tighten their grip in the north of the country. Malians for and against military intervention have protested on the streets of the capital in recent days, highlighting a divide in citizens' opinion. Last week, the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution that gives regional leaders 45 days to provide detailed plans for an international military intervention. Friday's meeting was a follow-up to the resolution. "Beyond this sad situation, there is the serious threat that the entrenchment of terrorist and criminal network poses to Mali, the region and beyond. This is a threat we cannot afford to take lightly, and the danger extends far beyond Africa. The sooner we deal with it, the better," said Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chief of the African Union Commission. Mali was plunged into chaos in March after a military ruler overthrew the president, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government. However, uncertainty looms as Islamist militants roaming the north wage a campaign of destruction. Soon after the coup, ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants took advantage of the power vacuum to seize the northern part of the country. Two groups with ties to al Qaeda later toppled the Tuareg movement, and now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of France. "The crisis is Malian, but the development affects the neighboring countries, our partners. And we need international help to fight the Islamists, to organize free and fair elections, and to help restore our country," interim Malian President Dioncounda Traore said. West African leaders and the transitional government have asked the United Nations Security Council to authorize military intervention to oust the rebels. The resolution approved last week tasked U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with working with African leaders to submit to the Security Council within 45 days "detailed and actionable recommendations" in preparation for the deployment of an international military force in Mali. As leaders work to find a solution, grim reports of human rights violations are emerging in the north. Radical Islamists are compiling a list of unmarried mothers , raising fears of cruel punishments such as stoning, amputations and executions, a senior United Nations official said this month. The list will include women who have had children out of wedlock and those who are unmarried and pregnant, according to Ivan Simonovic, the U.N. assistant secretary-general for human rights. The Islamists have vowed to impose a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. They say the law condemns relations outside marriage. Extremists have conducted public executions, amputations, floggings and other punishments. In addition to human rights violations, Islamists razed tombs near the desert city of Timbuktu on Thursday -- the latest attacks targeting cultural heritage sites in the north. The rebels have destroyed tombs and shrines in the city, which features various ancient and prominent burial sites. They regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their religion. Sufi shrines, which they consider sacrilegious, have been subjected to the most attacks. Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat by Islamic hardliners.

<title>Kerry: Saudi Arabia OK with international military strike on Syria - CNN.com</title>
<text>NEW: President Obama to talk Syria on Capitol Hill on Tuesday Qatar says it is examining options on how to deal with Syria Syrian president tells U.S. journalist that Syria is prepared to retaliate if U.S. attacks Syria crossed 'international, global red line,' he says Paris CNN -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Saudi Arabia will support military intervention in Syria by the United States and its partners. "They have supported the strike and they support taking action," Kerry said after a long meeting of Arab League ministers originally called to discuss the Mideast peace initiative. "They believe that it's very important to do that." Kerry told reporters he had a very good side meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, and Saudi Arabia was one of the countries to sign on to a statement condemning the reported use of chemical weapons last month by the Syrian military against rebels. Saudi Arabia is a diplomatic heavyweight in the Arab world but hasn't publicly called for an international military reprisal after the incident. With its vast air force and bases, Saudi Arabia could offer a lot of resources to Western militaries. But it's not expected to participate directly in any attack on Syria, because that would be likely to inflame a widespread Arabian Peninsula antipathy against Western military forces intruding into Arab affairs. Kerry also said the Arab League ministers unanimously condemned the August 21 incident. Syria chemical attack analysis Al-Assad: Expect retaliation for strike Christians under attack in Syria Congress gets to work on Syria "As we discussed today, all of us agreed -- not one dissenter -- that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's deplorable use of chemical weapons -- which we know killed hundreds of innocent people, including at least 426 children on this occasion, this one occasion -- this crosses an international, global red line," he said. He said the foreign ministers discussed the "possible and necessary measures" needed to deter al-Assad from using chemical weapons again. Kerry said a "number of countries immediately signed on" to an agreement reached by 12 countries on the side at the recent G20 summit. And while he named Saudi Arabia as one of those nations, he said the others that had agreed to help would make their announcements in the next day. The statement called for a "strong international response" and "supports efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons." It did not expressly endorse military action, although U.S. officials said the nations who signed it interpreted the statement as tacit support for strikes. The Syrian government has denied being behind chemical weapons attacks, which it blames on rebels. Al-Assad on Sunday denied again he had anything to do with the use of chemical agents, U.S. journalist Charlie Rose reported. The PBS anchor and CBS "This Morning" co-host said al-Assad told him during an interview to be broadcast Monday that Syria was prepared to retaliate if there was a military strike by the United States and its partners. "It doesn't surprise us that someone who would kill thousands of his own people, including hundreds of children, with poison gas would also lie about it," a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, said. Al-Assad's rare interview with U.S. media comes as U.S. President Barack Obama lobbies Congress and the country to support military action. Congress officially returns to Washington Monday after a monthlong summer recess to debate and vote on a resolution giving Obama the authorization to take military action. The president will go to Capitol Hill on Tuesday and make his case to Senate Democrats, a Senate leadership aide said Sunday. Obama will also address the nation on Syria Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET from the White House. Videos that purport to show the results of a chemical weapons attack are part of a White House campaign to inform Congress about the nature of the incident, Kerry said. "The reason for this is to make sure everybody understands what is at stake," he said. "Those videos make it clear to people that these are real human beings, real children, parents being affected in ways that are unacceptable to anybody, anywhere, by any standard." He said a vast majority of the members are undecided as to how they will vote on authorizing force against Syria. Qatari Foreign Minister Khalid bin Mohamed al-Attiyah appeared at the news conference with Kerry. "Qatar is currently studying with its friends and the United Nations what it could provide in order to protect the Syrian people," he said, according to a translator. Kerry met later with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague in London on Sunday. Britain's Parliament has ruled out getting militarily involved in Syria, but Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to continue to push for a tough response against the al-Assad regime. Kerry's efforts with European allies paralleled those of his boss, Obama, who tried to rally members of the G20 in St. Petersburg, Russia, last week. Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg summit Friday. But despite both saying the talks were constructive, there was no sign of consensus. CNN's Elise Labott reported from Paris. CNN's Steve Almasy reported and wrote from Atlanta.

<title>U.N. approves Central African Republic intervention amid killings - CNN.com</title>
<text>U.N. approves Central African Republic intervention as violence escalates By Nima Elbagir. Laura Smith-Spark and Faith Karimi, CNN updated 2:35 AM EST, Thu December 5, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: "It is clear that urgent action is needed to save lives," says U.S. envoy Power U.N. Security Council backs resolution authorizing African and French intervention Eight people have been killed and 65 injured in Bangui, Doctors Without Borders says Gunfire appears to target church compound where 35,000 Christians have taken refuge Bossangoa, Central African Republic CNN -- Months after a coup escalated chaos and violence in the Central African Republic, the U.N. Security Council on Thursday unanimously approved the deployment of African and French forces there. The council also voted to impose an arms embargo on the nation, which is east of Cameroon and north of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A representative of the Central African Republic told the council the vote would "give reasons to hope for a new dawn" for the country's embattled population. Speaking after the vote, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said the U.S. government was "deeply disturbed" by ongoing reports of brutality in the nation. "It is clear that urgent action is needed to save lives," she said, adding that the crisis has affected nearly half the country's population. U.N. warns against another "never again" Crisis in Central African Republic The Security Council resolution, put forward by France, authorizes an African Union-led peacekeeping force to intervene with the support of French forces to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. Hours before the meeting, heavy gunfire erupted near the presidential palace in the capital of Bangui, witnesses said. Samuel Henryon, of Doctors without Borders, told CNN that eight people were killed and 65 wounded in clashes in the city. The agency, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has 16 people helping at two hospitals where the wounded have been taken, it said in a statement. Twenty are badly hurt, most with gunshot, machete or knife wounds. An official with the African-led peacekeeping force in the Central African Republic, Jean Pierre Sadou, told CNN he had seen eight bodies in the street. He said he had been told there were more bodies near the National Assembly. Violence has raged in the country since a coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. Christian vigilante groups have formed to battle Seleka, the predominantly Muslim coalition behind the president's ouster. Multiple sources told CNN that the military commander of Seleka, Gen. Issa Yahya, was killed Thursday in Bangui. His second-in-command, Col. Saleh Zabari, is now thought to be in charge. Sadou said Seleka is now back in control of the center of Bangui and the situation there is quiet. Fighting continues near the airport, however. Members of Seleka told CNN that at least 30 people had been killed in the clashes in Bangui, men and women among them. Christians take refuge Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines, leading to fears of sectarian violence. The situation in Bossangoa, a town about 185 miles north of Bangui that is at the epicenter of displacement resulting from the violence, was extremely tense Thursday. About 35,000 Christians have taken refuge in a Catholic church compound there. The headquarters of the small regional peacekeeping mission told CNN that the second-in-command of Seleka had given the militia permission to attack the compound. The mission has sent reinforcements in defensive positions around the church to protect civilians. A CNN team in the vicinity could hear sustained gunfire and rocket-propelled grenade fire that appeared to be directed at the church compound. There is no word yet of any casualties or damage suffered. Speaking to CNN before reports of the death of Seleka's commander emerged, Zabari said that it was believed there were armed elements in the compound but that unless those inside moved against them, they wouldn't attack it. Power, the U.S. envoy, said the sectarian tension that has made the tens of thousands of Christians seek refuge in the church compound in Bossangoa, while their Muslim neighbors shelter in a mosque nearby, was a tragic result of the coup. "Extremists on both sides, in an environment of lawlessness and an environment of state failure, have taken advantage of that vacuum and stoked animosities," she said. The U.S. State Department said the United States was "appalled by today's reports of the murder of innocent women and children outside of Bangui" and was working with its international partners to find the best way to stabilize the situation. "This horrifying account is the latest in a string of reports that illustrate the deteriorating humanitarian and security situation in the Central African Republic that could lead to an escalation in violence and further atrocities," the State Department statement said. An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas too risky to access. United Nations officials have warned that the violence between the Christian majority and Muslim minority now in power could lead to genocide. More than 400,000 people -- nearly 10% of the population -- have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. "They are hiding in the bush without shelter, food, or drinking water, exposed to the weather and mosquitoes that carry malaria, the leading cause of death in the country," Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. The group has operated in the country for years and is helping dispatch mobile units to take care of the wounded. French troops An African Union force is already in the nation, but rights group say it's not enough to halt the escalating violence. Last month, France pledged to send about 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 already there. The troops currently there are deployed to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital, France said. Sources in the African Union mission to the Central African Republic said Wednesday that more French troops are on their way to the nation. France's ambassador to the United Nations, Gerard Araud, who holds the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council, welcomed the body's decision to intervene in what he said was a "forgotten crisis." The United Nations has suggested its peacekeeping force could eventually augment the African-led mission. Bozize fled the country after the coup led by rebel leader Michel Djotodia. A transitional government is in place led by Djotodia, who was commander of the Seleka rebels. But the country continues to be wracked by unrest and new elections have yet to be held.</text>

<title>Supreme Court narrowly limits reach of labor unions - CNN.com</title>
<text>Supreme Court narrowly limits reach of labor unions By Michael Pearson and Bill Mears, CNN updated 2:05 PM EDT, Mon June 30, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Illinois practice is clear First Amendment violation, Justice Samuel Alito writes NEW: Ruling threatens employee well-being and patient care, union says The ruling says Illinois home health care workers can't be forced to pay union dues Experts: Ruling will limit unions' ability to expand but doesn't deliver blow some had feared CNN -- In a decision that sidesteps a major shift in labor policy, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that Illinois can't force home health care workers to pay dues to unions. The narrow 5-4 ruling applies most directly to the Illinois home care providers who challenged a state decision to classify them as public employees and require them to pay fees to a union. But it also deals a blow to union efforts nationwide to extend their reach in an era of declining membership and political influence. "These home workers share a lot of attributes of the new emerging work force, and for unions, it's a big blow because that was their growth area," George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley said. "And it's going to be very difficult now to extend these contracts to get those types of dues." Still, the ruling was not as broad as many union activists had feared, falling well short of what some had predicted would be a vote to gut a 37-year-old Supreme Court decision allowing for what's known in labor circles as the agency shop system. Read the ruling PDF Instead, the court created a new category of "partial public employees" who can't be compelled to pay into the union system. "A narrow decision, a loss for the unions but not as catastrophic as many labor union people had feared," said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. The ruling stems from a decision by Illinois lawmakers to classify home health care workers paid by Medicaid as state employees and require them to pay fees to the Service Employees International Union. The union exclusively bargains with the state over wages, hours and working conditions. The employees, most of whom were hired by individual patients and reimbursed through Medicaid, argued that they were being forced to subsidize the union's efforts in violation of constitutional rights of free speech and free association. State officials argued that mandatory union representation increased wages and benefits, reduced employee turnover and improved training and supervision. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the conservative majority, said the practice was a clear violation of the First Amendment. "If we accepted Illinois' argument, we would approve an unprecedented violation of the bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support," Alito wrote. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent that in terms of the 1977 ruling that allowed agency shops, there was no difference between the home health workers and more traditional state employees. Labor union allies picked up on that line of reasoning. "The Supreme Court's ruling is a serious concern for workers' rights across the country -- employees whose job qualifications, evaluations, salaries, work hours, training, and wages are all controlled by the state are, in every sense of the word, public sector employees," Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said in a statement. "Failure to recognize this fact, and to provide the collective bargaining rights that go along with it, will harm workers and families across the country," Carey said. The union involved in the case, the Service Employees International Union, said in a statement that the ruling "places at risk a system of consumer-directed home care in Illinois that has proven successful in raising wages, providing affordable health care benefits, and increasing training." But union President Mary Kay Henry said the effort to unionize workers would continue. "No court case is going to stand in the way of home care workers coming together to have a strong voice for good jobs and quality home care," she said. Fordham University law professor James Brudney said the ruling "strikes a blow against efforts to address the serious problem of income inequality in this country." "Home care employees are among our lowest-paid workers, and this decision will make it harder for them to come together to improve conditions." The conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, however, celebrated the ruling as a major victory. "This decision delivers a major blow to the coercive powers of government unions," institute policy analyst Trey Kovacs said in a statement. "The ruling frees thousands of home care and child care providers from financially assisting government unions that they disagree with." CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Bill Mears reported and wrote from Washington.</text>

<title>Labor Day: How Democrats, unions broke up (Opinion) - CNN.com</title>
<text>How labor unions and Democrats fell out of love By Julian Zelizer updated 12:25 PM EDT, Sun August 31, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Julian Zelizer: Democrats and unions used to link their fortunes for mutual gain. That's declined He says union membership down, Democrats shy away, vexing union leaders But unions' core mission reflects Democrats' basic goals: financial security for workers, he says Zelizer: In era of income inequality, Dems, unions should be allies, especially as GOP isn't Editor's note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Jimmy Carter" and "Governing America." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- Labor Day used to be a big deal for the Democratic Party. For much of the 20th century, organized labor was at the heart of Democratic politics. Unions were a driving force that gave the party its heart and its muscle. Unfortunately for Democrats, the importance of organized labor has diminished dramatically since the 1970s. Union membership has declined from nearly 30% of the workforce in the 1960s, according to the Congressional Research Service, to what the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs at about 11% today. Politically, unions have become more controversial among Democrats: Once the status quo among Democrats, now they are often seen as outliers. Many Democrats since the 1960s, including some environmentalists and civil rights advocates, concluded that unions were too often in opposition to their goals. Even though he came from a progressive background, President Obama has repeatedly disappointed union leaders with his failure to support key proposals that would make it easier for unions to grow. Julian Zelizer The loss of organized labor's clout within the workforce and among the Democrats has been a devastating loss for the party. As the party turned away from this constituency and hesitated to support policies that would reverse the damaging trends that have hindered union membership, they have lost an animating force that could help sustain them in their struggles against a rightward bound Republican Party. The relationship has a long, important history. The union movement was pivotal to the success of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the 1930s. FDR and northern Democrats pursued policies greatly benefiting the organization of industrial workers in Northern states like Michigan and Wisconsin. View my Flipboard Magazine. In 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act also known as the Wagner Act, which formally gave workers the right to join a union and created the National Labor Relations Board, ensuring that employers allowed legitimate elections to take place. In 1936, Roosevelt said: "The Fourth of July commemorates our political freedom. Labor Day symbolizes our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality." While FDR's policies benefited workers, including the new Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO , labor came out in droves for the Democrats. They rallied workers on Election Day, encouraged their members to show support for the party that had helped them, raised money to help Democrats succeed, and their lobbyists on Capitol Hill constantly helped round up votes for a liberal agenda that ranged from bills that directly benefited workers to other measures with even greater constituencies. At the height of its power, the civil rights movement relied heavily on union leaders like Walter Reuther to win support for legislation in Congress. Unions were not simply useful allies; their core mission embodied the basic goals of the Democratic Party after FDR. The entire point of collective bargaining was to create an economic system that would ensure a base of financial security for a large number of workers. Unions could fight for the kinds of jobs that would create a ladder for hardworking Americans to enter into the middle class. Supreme Court gives blow to unions Inside Man: Unions Without unions and the kinds of policies they helped Democrats find support for, leaders like Reuther realized, there would be very little to prevent the middle class from gradually withering away. From a very early moment in the century—long before economist Thomas Piketty was publishing his controversial book on inequality, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" —unions insisted that the organizational basis of economic opportunity depended on workers acting in unison. The situation for organized labor took a terrible turn starting in the 1970s. Many of the industries that were most heavily unionized in Northern states weakened. Owners moved factories and their jobs to Southern states, which had tough right-to-work laws that made it illegal to force workers in an organized workplace to join the union and pay dues, or transported business overseas. Many of the most vibrant parts of the economy, such as the service and high-tech sector, did not offer unionized jobs. Federal policies were no longer hospitable to unions. Conservatives turned to legislation like the Taft-Hartley Act 1947 to squeeze union power. Some workers from unions turned to the Republican Party as part of the backlash to liberalism that unfolded after the 1960s. As labor became less important, a large number of Democrats became cool to unions. President Carter angered union leaders in the late 1970s when he pushed for fiscal austerity and didn't back legislation that would have protected boycotts. President Clinton clashed with unions over issues, including the NAFTA free trade treaty, while President Obama disappointed many when he didn't push for the Employee Free Choice Act in 2009 and 2010. This tension is one that Democrats need to ease. Not only would the party benefit from healthier, more harmonious ties to the union movement, but also benefit from making the expansion of union membership and protection of labor rights a more central part of its national agenda. In an era when so many Americans worry about growing economic inequality and are desperate for answers to how the federal government and the private marketplace can stop the damage to the middle class, stronger support for unions would be a powerful step for Democrats to take. "As unions shrank," wrote Harold Meyerson, "inequality grew." Democrats could offer a real alternative. It would offer a stark contrast to a Republican Party that has been extremely aggressive, at the national and state level, in its attacks on unions and the organization of the workforce. Only if Democrats take this step will they be able to nurture the part of their political coalition that was once so strong but is now so frail. Only then will Democrats once again start to celebrate and appreciate the importance of Labor Day to their party.</text>

<title>Obama: 'I'd join a union' - CNN.com</title>
<text>Obama: 'I'd join a union' By Dan Merica, CNN updated 8:49 AM EDT, Tue September 2, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS President Obama praised unions in a Milwaukee speech on Labor Day He blasted Republicans for being obstructionists, arguing they "say no to everything" Democrat Mary Burke, who's running for governor in Wisconsin, didn't appear publicly with Obama Republican Gov. Scott Walker greeted Obama at the airport Milwaukee CNN -- President Barack Obama told a large union audience in Wisconsin on Monday that while "Republicans in Congress love to say no," he is the one who "placed a bet on America's workers." In a speech that skirted the line between politics and policy, Obama outlined what many Democrats are using as a midterm platform, highlighting hopes to raise the minimum wage and pass immigration reform. Obama also used the speech to portray Republicans as obstructionists who are holding the country back. The President told the receptive audience that "most of the policies I am talking about have two things in common. They are going to help more families get ahead. And Republicans who run our Congress oppose almost all of them." When the crowd broke out in a chorus of boos, Obama reflexively turned to a now oft-used line: "Don't boo, vote. Don't boo, vote. It is easy to boo, I want you to vote." The political line was a staple during Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. "I want an economy where your hard work pays off with higher wages and higher income and fair pay for women and workplace flexibility for parents and affordable health insurance and decent retirement benefits," Obama said. "I'm not asking for the moon, I just want a good deal for American workers." Although the Obama administration billed the appearance as an official White House event set to "underscore the important progress America has made since the economic collapse," the Laborfest speech featured a jacket-less Obama who, for most the most part, appeared to be in campaign mode. "I think eventually Congress is going to hear them. We'll break those folks down. We'll just stay on it. We'll just keep at it," Obama said. "'Cause the only thing more powerful than an idea whose time has come is when millions of people organizing around an idea whose time has come. Millions of people are voting for an idea whose time has come." The President used the Labor Day gathering of 6,000 union members and their families to herald organized labor's role in passing the 40-hour work week, overtime pay for workers and a minimum wage. Standing before helmet-clad workers sporting "We Are One" t-shirts, Obama also said he would likely join a union. "If I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my job, I'd join a union," the President said to raucous applause. "If I were busting my butt in the service industry and wanted an honest day's pay for an honest day's work, I'd join a union...I'd want a union looking out for me and if I cared about these things I'd also want more Democrats looking out for me." The midterms are important for Democrats and Obama's legacy. Midterms in a second term are historically bad for the President's party, and Democrats are facing the prospect of losing the Senate and staying the minority in the House in 2014. "Republicans in Congress love to say no," Obama said. "Those are just facts, the facts of life. They say no to everything." While Obama focused much of the speech on the midterms, he was noticeably mum on Wisconsin's hotly contested race for governor between Democrat Mary Burke and Republican incumbent Scott Walker. According to a Marquette Law School poll , 49% of likely Wisconsin voters support Burke compared to 47% for Walker. The survey has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, which means the two candidates are locked in a statistical dead heat. Before Obama's speech, Burke walked around Laborfest and shook hands with supporters and union members. Burke and Obama did not appear on stage together, but the gubernatorial candidate did tweet that she had a "great chat" with Obama backstage and that she looks "fwd to seeing him again b4 11/4." A spokesman for Burke said before the event that the two won't appear together because the event is "an official White House event and not a campaign event," therefore her "participation in the public portion of events would not be appropriate." A Democratic National Committee official told CNN last week that Obama will appear with Burke before Election Day. Obama also met Walker, who greeted and shook hands with the President when he walked off Air Force One at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee. "Had no problem greeting the President just like I have no problem explaining how I differ with him on things like ObamaCare," Walker tweeted Monday night. Wisconsin has been a friendly state for Obama. In 2008, he won the state by 14 points and in 2012 he carried the state by seven points.</text>

<title>Analysis: Why America's unions are losing power - CNN.com</title>
<text>Michigan bills pass amid large protests Gov. Snyder: This is good for Michigan Obama: Unions built a stronger America Michigan's fight over 'right-to-work' America's up and down relationship with unions Union supporters in Michigan didn't go down without a fight. They staged a rally outside the state capitol in Lansing as lawmakers voted. "People need to wake up and fight," teacher Sarah Zigler said at Tuesday's rally. "People need to realize what unions have done for them. Who gave people the 40-hour work week Who fought for workplace safety Who brought you the weekend Who brought you workers comp Who gave people overtime pay" "Unions!" protesters shouted after each of her questions. For much of American history, unions have been credited with helping millions achieve the American dream and criticized for "heavy-handed" operations They were also reviled for corruption in the days of Jimmy Hoffa .. But unions have long remained a force to be reckoned with. Today, Michigan becomes the latest state in the Rust Belt, the heart of America's manufacturing industry, to chip away at their power. Earlier this year, Wisconsin had its own showdown over the power of unions when Gov. Scott Walker -- who opposes unions -- overcame an attempt to recall him from office . The failed recall vote was fueled by anger over laws he pushed that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions. Indiana also passed a right-to-work law this year. While there have been moments of good news for organized labor, including pay bumps for GM autoworkers , industry analysts agree that organized labor no longer holds the sway it once did among America's workers. So why the downfall of American unions That depends on who you ask. Blaming big business Big businesses are behind campaigns to squelch organized labor, and they are seeing some success, according to Gordon Lafer, a political science professor and opponent of right-to-work laws. What right to work really means "The anti-union campaigns of the last three years, starting with Wisconsin, have really been driven ... by big national organizations and money," said Lafer, a union member and who teaches labor studies at the University of Oregon. "I think an important question to think about is: Why are big private companies spending a lot of money and energy fighting public sector unions "They want more free trade, lower minimum wage, the right not to pay sick leave, and all those things which are not per se about union contracts. But the biggest single opponent they have is the labor movement, even in its shrunken and weaker state." Lafer blames businesses and key business figures for lobbying to push such laws "not because of what unions are doing now for their own members but to get them out of the way on issues that will affect everybody else." These campaigns stigmatize unions and encourage people who are unemployed to resent unions rather than big business leaders, he argued. "Their fear is populism," he said, referring to those who are "at the top of the economy, during downward mobility." They want the discontent to not be aimed at people running the economy. Gordon Lafer, University of Oregon "They want the discontent to not be aimed at people running the economy." There's also an element of fear among those who have jobs, he said. In this time of economic uncertainty, workers are afraid to organize because they don't want to upset their employers and lose their jobs. It's the economy For businesses to recover from the recession and build jobs in America, they need to get out from under organized labor, according to some analysts. And that has led to the decline of union power -- which is good news, they say. "Unions have lost power in the private sector over time because of competition, globalization, and the fact that they don't add any value to worker productivity," said Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute and a fan of right-to-work laws. Businesses are responding to today's realities and "can't pay above-market wages forever," he said. "So either they will move work abroad or they will automate to try to get rid of as many workers as they can." To build jobs in America, Edwards said businesses can't be beholden to mandatory collective bargaining, which can increase wages and expenses without increasing profits. Unions are going the way of the dinosaur in the U.S. private sector... Good riddance. Chris Edwards, Cato Institute In recent years, the retirement of baby boomers has fueled anti-union sentiment as some companies struggle to pay pensions as well as health care for the aging population -- benefits that were negotiated through collective bargaining. And, Edwards notes, that pressure comes on top of the economic downturn. Listen to how unions are bracing for a long battle "Unions are going the way of the dinosaur in the U.S. private sector, which is a good thing for workers and businesses because it will make America more competitive," he said. "If right-to-work laws extend to the 50 states, then private sector unions will be dead in America." How does Edwards feel about the death of all private sector unions "Good riddance," he said. Is it all about red vs. blue The decline in union strength is also tied to the political battle between Democrats and Republicans. "There has been a recognition by both the unions and people who are not happy with unions in the last 12 years or so that unions have been fundamentally the powerhouse between the Democratic party and their electoral math," said Linda Kaboolian, lecturer on public policy with Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Unions provide money and put "boots on the ground" to get Democratic candidates elected. If they shrink, so will the money and power of that central blue voting bloc, Kaboolian said, adding that "it's a perfectly rational point of view" for right-wing organizations to take. Union organizers did a great deal to push for President Barack Obama's re-election in key states, including Michigan. The president himself paid a visit to the state this week, voicing his opposition to the state's right-to-work measure. "What we shouldn't do is take away your rights to bargain for better wages," Obama told workers. "These so called right to work laws don't have to do with economics, they have to do with politics." Kaboolian insisted that economic arguments for slicing union strength don't add up. Even if unionized workers cost more, they can often prove to be a higher-quality work force that will last, grow and learn new skills, she says. Kaboolian speaks of her own experience, having served as a union officer at the University of Michigan. She was also a manager and a worker in both unionized and non-unionized agencies. She said she does not advocate for or against right-to-work laws. James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation rejected the idea that unions' decline are tied to American politics. He said the changes are being driven "by efforts to attract business," not an underhanded political effort, he says. "We're coming out of a pretty nasty recession ... Businesses understandably don't want to be unionized."</text>

<title>Nigerian labor unions, government resume talks to end fuel strikes - CNN.com</title>
<text>Nigerian labor unions, government resume talks to end fuel strikes By the CNN Wire Staff updated 6:25 PM EST, Sun January 15, 2012 Nigerians have taken to the streets to demand the return of fuel subsidies in Africa's most populous nation STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: President Goodluck Jonathan is participating directly in the talks, sources say The national strike started last week in response to a government move to end fuel subsidies Labor unions urge protesters to take a weekend break to stock up on food and water Protests will resume Monday if both sides don't reach a deal, a union official says Are you protesting fuel prices in Nigeria Send CNN iReport your stories, videos Lagos, Nigeria CNN -- Nigerian labor unions resumed talks with the government Sunday in a bid to reach a deal to stop a national strike over soaring fuel prices, sources close to the negotiations said. President Goodluck Jonathan participated directly in the discussions, they said. Late-night wrangling ended earlier in the day without a compromise. Oil labor unions will not shut down production of crude as planned, according to union sources who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks. Last week, a major oil union, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, threatened to halt production Sunday in solidarity with protesters if the two sides don't reach an agreement. A move to halt production would reverberate on the global market -- Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest crude exporter. Nigerian protestor: 'I'm ready to die' Outrage over fuel prices in Nigeria Protests over fuel price rise in Nigeria Nigerian finance minister talks strikes Throngs of protesters have taken to the streets to demand government accountability and a return of fuel subsidies that ended on January 1, a move that doubled gas prices and sent the cost of other goods skyrocketing. Scattered protests escalated into a national strike that started Monday, paralyzing the nation of more than 160 million people. Union leaders called for a temporary suspension to the national strikes for the weekend to allow protesters to stock up on food and water, but said they would resume Monday if the subsidies are not reinstated. "The whole labor movement will return to strike Monday but negotiations are continuing," said Elijah Okubu, president of NUPENG, another oil workers' union. "Negotiation is the hallmark of industrial relations." Nigerians flocked to stores Sunday to buy basic necessities amid uncertainty on how long protests will last once they resume. Long lines snaked around gas stations, as crowds flooded markets to buy food. Demonstrations started as an outcry against the removal of fuel subsidies and grew into anger against government corruption. Nigerians consider the subsidies one of the few benefits of living in an oil-producing nation that has little infrastructure, high unemployment and intermittent electricity. The protests -- dubbed "Occupy Nigeria" -- have galvanized the continent's most populous nation. Nigerians accuse their leaders of corruption and misusing oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. The government has said the removal will free up billions this year to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure; Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nigerians should not let the past determine the future. She said the goal now is to regain the citizens' trust and move forward. "They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward," she said. CNN's Nima Elbagir contributed to this report Part of complete coverage on Islamist group extends campaign updated 8:50 AM EST, Mon January 30, 2012 Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has shifted his attitude toward the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, as violence spreads.

<title>Justices deny review of gun-rights appeals - CNN.com</title>
<text>Justices deny review of gun-rights appeals By Bill Mears, CNN Supreme Court Producer updated 2:51 PM EST, Mon February 24, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Court declined to review two cases brought by National Rifle Association The decision is seens as a temporary setback for gun rights advocates Gun-control efforts have stalled in Congress despite Newtown and a string of other mass shootings CNN -- The Supreme Court for now is staying out of the hot-button issue of concealed weapons laws. The Justices on Monday declined to review two cases brought by the National Rifle Association that deal with whether those age 18-20 can buy and then carry handguns in public for self-defense. The justices gave no reason for denying those cases and a third gun-control appeal on out-of-state weapon transfers. The decision not to intervene means the state and federal laws at issue will remain in effect, and are at least a temporary setback for gun-rights advocates. The NRA had hoped the court was prepared to address a broader, politically explosive issue-- whether there was a fundamental constitutional right to carry a concealed weapon in public. The Supreme Court in 2008 said the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have a handgun in the home to protect life and property. Both current handgun cases originated in Texas, which included a challenge to state restrictions over "concealed carry" permits. At issue in NRA v. McCraw 13-390 was whether the right to bear arms in public for self-defense extends to responsible, law-abiding 18- to 20-year-olds. State law permits those 21 and older to apply for a license to carry a concealed weapon. Many states have similar restrictions, citing concerns over crime rates among certain young adults, and whether they have the necessary level of maturity and responsibility to carry a handgun. The second legal challenge dealt with a 1968 congressional law that restricts sales of handguns by federally-licensed firearms dealers only to those 21 and older. Those 18-to-20 may still be allowed to purchase shotguns and certain type of rifles, or receive handguns as a gift. Two young Texas gun owners-- Andrew Payne and Katherine Taggart-- had brought the original lawsuit in NRA v. ATF 13-137. Again, the nation's most powerful gun rights group failed to convince the high court to address whether a nationwide, class-based, categorical ban on meaningful access to exercise the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense violated the Second Amendment. The justices also turned down a more narrow appeal in Lane v. Holder 12-1401, denying gun owners in Washington D.C. the ability to sue over city laws making it hard to legally transfer weapons purchased in nearby jurisdictions. Since the nation's capital does not have any federally-licensed gun shops, residents seeking a handgun typically have to go to nearby Virginia or Maryland. Once the high court established an "individual" right to keep a handgun in the home, it has been reluctant to broaden that right in a variety of subsequent challenges to other firearm restrictions. The Justice Department estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the United States. In 2005, the last time figures were available, three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns. Paul Clement, a Washington lawyer challenging the federal restrictions on handgun sales to those under 21, expressed frustration at that reluctance. "Given the number of laws enacted by the federal government, states, and localities in the years when a mistaken understanding of the Second Amendment held sway, one would have expected a major reconsideration of extant firearms laws to have occurred," said Clement in a brief filed with the court. "Instead, jurisdictions have engaged in massive resistance to the clear import of those landmark decisions, and the lower federal courts, long out of the habit of taking the Second Amendment seriously, have largely facilitated the resistance," he said. Efforts to craft compromise gun-control legislation have stalled in Congress despite the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since. The high court six years ago -- for the first time -- affirmed an individual's right to own a firearm, when it struck down Washington D.C.'s handgun restrictions. But the court confined its analysis just to the home, leaving in place other gun control laws, including those "forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools." While the court for now is staying out of the concealed carry issue, it may be forced back into the debate. Federal appeals courts in Philadelphia and San Francisco have issued opposite rulings in recent weeks.</text>

<title>Opinion: Gun debate? What gun debate? - CNN.com</title>
<text>Gun debate What gun debate By Mark O'Mara updated 5:28 PM EDT, Wed June 11, 2014 Friends, family and others hold candles for the victim of a school shooting at a vigil Tuesday, June 10 in Troutdale, Oregon, near Portland. A student shot and killed another student at Reynolds High School before apparently taking his own life, law enforcement sources said. Troutdale Mayor Doug Daoust addresses reporters at a June 10 press conference in a Safeway parking lot near the school. Students look for family members after arriving at a shopping center parking lot June 10 in Wood Village, Oregon, after the shooting in nearby Troutdale. Parents anxiously wait for their children at the shopping center parking lot in Wood Village on June 10. Buses arrive at a grocery store parking lot in Wood Village on June 10 to reunite students with their parents after the shooting. A distraught woman waits for news after the school shooting June 10. The shooting happened at about 8 a.m., said Sue Strickland of the Troutdale Police Department. A semiautomatic weapon was involved in the shooting, she said. Family and friends of Reynolds High School students waited outside for word of students' safety. Details about what led to the shooting weren't immediately available. About an hour after the shooting, Oregon State Police said the area was secure and the situation was contained. Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland, has a population of about 16,400, according to the Census Bureau. HIDE CAPTION Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school Shooting at Oregon high school &gt;&gt; Mark O'Mara: America appears to have settled its gun debate He says inflexible owners must view school shooting as collateral of "right" to bear arms He says we don't further restrict drinking because of DWI. Have we made that deal on guns O'Mara: Face it: Restricting guns won't hurt Constitution, cause anarchy; it will protect us Editor's note: Mark O'Mara is a CNN legal analyst. He is a criminal defense attorney who frequently writes and speaks about issues related to race, guns and self-defense in the context of the American criminal justice system. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- Gun debate What gun debate Americans seem to have this settled. Yes, we witnessed on our TV screens this week yet another parade of children being evacuated from their school — this time in Oregon -- their arms held high to show they were not armed as they fled a 15-year-old shooter who police said took the life of their 14-year-old classmate. Mark O'Mara But Americans, ever more desensitized to the school/mall/navy yard attacks that come, weekly, into their lives, don't seem to want to talk about a gun problem. Americans remain pleased for the general population -- even 15-year-old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms, including assault rifles. Even the President seems to have acquiesced. A tweet from @WhiteHouse: "'If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change.' -- President Obama on legislation to prevent gun violence." What this means is that we've accepted school shootings and other random mass shootings as a normal part of life in America, no matter how they affect the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness that was first announced in the Declaration of Independence, some 13 years before our oft-quoted Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I guess that's not surprising: We accept collateral damage for other privileges we enjoy. We tolerate a certain number of drunk driving deaths, more than 10,000 in 2012 , and there's little public outcry for greater restrictions. We've been willing to sacrifice nearly 7,000 soldiers and tens of thousands wounded in two wars to maintain our political influence in the Middle East. About 400 children drown each year in pools and spas , but we're not scrambling to outlaw summer fun. Why should guns be any different In the United States only about 10 people out of every 100,000 are killed by guns, or a little more than 30,000 per year As a reference, we lost about 60,000 soldiers in the Vietnam War. This is clearly an acceptable sacrifice to make to maintain our sacred, un-infringed right to bear arms, no Police: Shooter and victim not linked Student recalls Oregon school lockdown New video shows shooters' last moments After all, I've been told by some gun-rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in America. And if we didn't have unfettered access to guns, think about what would happen: We would be overrun by a foreign power; our government would assume totalitarian control and burn the Constitution; and criminal gangs, the only people left with guns, would run roughshod over all law-abiding citizens. If you suggest, as I have, that we should place reasonable restrictions on guns, then you are clearly a delusional or ignorant pacifist who has been dropped on his head. What part of "shall not be infringed" don't you understand they ask. For the record, I'm a responsible gun owner. I'm confident that in the next few weeks there will be another school shooting. I'm confident because there have been 74 shootings on or around schools or colleges in the year and a half since the Sandy Hook massacre. That's averaging one a week. I'll repeat: We have a gun problem in this country. Reasonable restrictions on guns will not lead to totalitarianism and anarchy. Suffering 30,000 gun deaths annually is not a reasonable sacrifice to make in order to blindly maintain our unrestricted gun culture, particularly when the rallying cry is an outdated reference concerning infringement which, known to anyone who has actually studied the Constitution and our founding fathers who drafted it, was a reference to the then-existing reality that young men, when called upon to defend the state and the laws of the state, were expected to provide their own arms. Listen, reasonable restrictions are necessary to assure the continued viability of our Second Amendment rights, and to curb the unnecessary bloodshed caused by the proliferation of guns into hands of irresponsible people who care little about constitutional rights, and less about the sanctity of life. Like that of a boy in Oregon, who was shot dead.</text>

<title>Opinion: We need federal, not state, gun policy - CNN.com</title>
<text>We need federal, not state, gun policy By Jill Koyama updated 8:50 AM EDT, Fri April 18, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Michael Bloomberg is spending $50 million to stem the tide of gun violence Jill Koyama: We need a federal policy rather than piecemeal state legislation She says we need to strengthen background checks and ban assault weapons Koyama: We must find a way to preserve individual rights and reduce gun violence Editor's note: Jill Koyama is an anthropologist and assistant professor of educational policy studies and practice at the University of Arizona. She is a fellow in the Op-Ed Project. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN -- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg plans to spend $50 million of his own money to build a state-by-state grass-roots network focused on stemming the tide of gun violence by expanding the background check system for gun buyers. His new organization, Everytown for Gun Safety , will bring together Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Moms Demand Actions for Gun Sense in America, two gun control groups he already funds. Everytown for Gun Safety will focus on 15 states because, Bloomberg says, we've got to work at gun control "piece by piece." There's no disputing that gun violence in America needs to be tackled. Bloomberg is making a sizable investment, $30 million more than what the NRA -- the largest U.S. lobby group for gun rights -- spent in the 2012 election cycle. Jill Koyama But there are two problems. First, do we want mega-rich individuals to influence public policy or sway voters with their wealth And, second, just as we need a federal immigration policy instead of piecemeal state legislation, don't we need a federal gun control policy I grew up in a family that owned guns. My father was a homicide detective and a member of the police department's SWAT team. He was also a hunter, as was my maternal grandfather. My stepfather, as a member of the Air Force, was well-trained in firearms. As a child, I was taught the basics of gun safety, and I often accompanied one of these men when they honed their hunting skills through target practice or skeet shooting. Even though I was familiar with guns, they scared me, and I often worried that my father would be fatally shot by a criminal. This worry ended when he retired from the police force, but my fear of guns persisted. The recent fatal shootings at Fort Hood and the Jewish Center in Kansas City have again brought my gun fears to the surface. I do not welcome the fears, but I do appreciate how the shootings have renewed the debate about gun control in Washington. Perhaps Bloomberg's new gun control group will fuel the debate further. Bloomberg isn't the only one who cares about this issue, but he may be the most prominent. We need more big voices to get involved in solving the problem of senseless gun violence in America. But we also need to get some basic facts straight. -- Guns kill. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reports that an average of 86 people are killed by guns every day in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that between 2000 and 2010, more than 300,000 people died from guns. -- Guns are the most common weapon used in murders and manslaughters . Handguns comprised 72.5% of the firearms used in murder and non-negligent manslaughter incidents in 2011: 4.1% were with shotguns, 3.8% were with rifles,18.5% were with unspecified firearms. -- Children are often victims of gun violence. Eighty-two children under 5 years old died from firearms in 2010, and half of all juveniles killed in the same year were killed with a gun. As reported by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, nearly three times more children were injured by firearms in 2010 than the number of U.S. soldiers wounded in action the same year in the war in Afghanistan. -- Guns kill young African-American men more than anything else. In deaths of 15- to 24-year-olds, firearms homicide rates in the United States are about 43 times higher than in other developed countries, and for young African-American men ages 15-24, it's the leading cause of death . For African-American male youth, firearms homicides surpass unintentional injuries, cancer, HIV and other diseases combined. Of course, gun rights advocates often point out that people don't need guns to kill. They can use other weapons such as knives. This is true, but in practice people are nowhere near as likely to get killed with a knife. In America, of 14,022 homicides in 2011, 11,101 were committed with firearms . The rate of fatality is nearly four times higher when someone uses a gun rather than a knife to assault another person. Stronger background screenings of potential gun owners would be a good start to curtailing firearm deaths. A study to be published in a forthcoming issue of Journal of Urban Health shows that when Missouri repealed a handgun law in 2007 that required all handgun purchasers to verify that they had passed a background check, the murder rate increased by 16%, adding 55 to 63 murders per year. Even before the results of the study were released, many Americans -- including most gun owners -- supported universal background checks. That's just one reason for Congress to pick up the issue of gun control again. Another is that since the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, which was the last time there was a serious debate about gun control, there have been 44 more school shootings and 28 deaths . Now that the debate has again been sparked, let's try to find ways that would both preserve individual rights and make guns less responsible for deaths. A common sense approach is offered in the 2013 book "Reducing Gun Violence in America: Informing Policy with Evidence and Analysis" by Daniel Webster and Jon Vernick, with a forward by Michael Bloomberg. We should strengthen background checks, ban assault weapons and magazines that fire more than 10 rounds, and fund research on what actually works to end gun violence. If you agree, please follow something my father, an avid gun lover, liked to say: We need to make it tough to get guns because too many careless people use them to end petty arguments and squabbles. Let's not try to do it state by state. Let's take a stance as a nation. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.</text>

<sentence cont=0 >Even though I was familiar with guns, they scared me, and I often worried that my father would be fatally shot by a criminal.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >This worry ended when he retired from the police force, but my fear of guns persisted.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The recent fatal shootings at Fort Hood and the Jewish Center in Kansas City have again brought my gun fears to the surface.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >I do not welcome the fears, but I do appreciate how the shootings have renewed the debate about gun control in Washington.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Perhaps Bloomberg's new gun control group will fuel the debate further.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Bloomberg isn't the only one who cares about this issue, but he may be the most prominent.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >We need more big voices to get involved in solving the problem of senseless gun violence in America.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >But we also need to get some basic facts straight. -- Guns kill.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reports that an average of 86 people are killed by guns every day in the United States.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that between 2000 and 2010, more than 300,000 people died from guns. -- Guns are the most common weapon used in murders and manslaughters .</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Handguns comprised 72.5% of the firearms used in murder and non-negligent manslaughter incidents in 2011: 4.1% were with shotguns, 3.8% were with rifles,18.5% were with unspecified firearms. -- Children are often victims of gun violence.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Eighty-two children under 5 years old died from firearms in 2010, and half of all juveniles killed in the same year were killed with a gun.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >As reported by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, nearly three times more children were injured by firearms in 2010 than the number of U.S. soldiers wounded in action the same year in the war in Afghanistan. -- Guns kill young African-American men more than anything else.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >In deaths of 15- to 24-year-olds, firearms homicide rates in the United States are about 43 times higher than in other developed countries, and for young African-American men ages 15-24, it's the leading cause of death .</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >For African-American male youth, firearms homicides surpass unintentional injuries, cancer, HIV and other diseases combined.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Of course, gun rights advocates often point out that people don't need guns to kill.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >They can use other weapons such as knives.</sentence>

<sentence cont=0 >In America, of 14,022 homicides in 2011, 11,101 were committed with firearms .</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The rate of fatality is nearly four times higher when someone uses a gun rather than a knife to assault another person.</sentence>

<title>Paul: The government wants your gun rights - CNN.com</title>
<text>The government wants your gun rights By Rand Paul, Special to CNN updated 12:40 PM EDT, Wed April 10, 2013 Craig Bentley's T-shirt reveals his point of view at President Obama's speech at the University of Hartford urging gun control. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Rand Paul says he vowed to uphold all constitutional rights, including gun ownership Paul: Nothing in proposed gun laws would prevent tragedies such as the Newtown massacre Paul: More regulations could lead to government surveillance, disarm law-abiding people More senators need to stand up for the Second Amendment or rights will be lost, he says Editor's note: Rand Paul is a Republican senator from Kentucky and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committees. CNN -- Congress is debating legislation that will limit Americans' right to keep and bear arms and infringe on the right to privacy. The Bill of Rights was made part of our Constitution explicitly to protect freedoms: the freedom of speech, protection against searches without a warrant, the right to trial by jury and the right to protect oneself with a firearm. I am compelled to stand up for every amendment and right enumerated in the Constitution. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is attempting to push forward with gun control legislation. The chief problem I have is that nothing in this legislation would have prevented the terrible massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. I am open to ideas that would help prevent tragedies, but this legislation would not have saved us from the national heartbreak of the December school shooting. Sen. Rand Paul I oppose legislation that undermines Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. I worry that legislation mandating more regulations on law-abiding citizens will lead to an infringement on the ability to exercise constitutional rights without being subject to government surveillance. I also worry that these efforts will merely disarm the people who follow the law and empower those who ignore it. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter . We welcome your ideas and comments. Along with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, I circulated a letter promising to "oppose any legislation that would infringe on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance." We have been joined by Sens. Marco Rubio, Jim Inhofe, Jerry Moran, Richard Burr, Ron Johnson, Mike Enzi, James Risch, Mike Crapo, Dan Coats and Pat Roberts. But more senators need to stand up for our Second Amendment rights or the rights will be lost. Both the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union and the right-leaning Heritage Foundation have raised privacy concerns about the legislation pending before Congress. Chris Calabrese of the ACLU was quoted recently saying that he worries about submitted gun control legislation that may lead to the "creation of government databases and collections of personal information on all of us." David Addington of the Heritage Foundation worries that "loose language" in the submitted legislation may lead to the government keeping "centralized records of who received what guns and where." These are privacy concerns that I share. Gabby Giffords appreciates guns Obama becomes emotional over gun control Effect of new gun laws on manufacturers Potentially on the table are new laws that would outlaw firearms and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds as well as require universal background checks, which effectively restrict the right of law-abiding citizens to buy guns at gun shows and give or sell them to friends and family without having to get the government's permission. One version of the legislation pending before the Senate goes so far as to empower the attorney general to tax gun transactions and creates a new felony crime for knowingly failing to report for more than 24 hours that a gun has been lost or stolen. Legislation being pushed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California arbitrarily bans certain weapons. President Barack Obama has conceded that this idea may not pass during a comprehensive gun debate, yet I worry that the idea may come up again once Congress passes the first round of gun control. Americans exercise their right every day to protect themselves and their families. Recently, a 14-year-old Phoenix boy shot an armed intruder who broke into his home while he was baby-sitting his three younger siblings. The children were home alone on a Saturday afternoon when an unrecognized woman rang their doorbell. After the teenager refused to open the door, he heard someone trying to break into the house. The boy hurried his younger siblings upstairs and collected a handgun from his parents' room. When the boy rounded the top of the stairs, a man was standing in the doorway with a gun pointed at him. The boy shot the intruder and possibly saved the lives of his three siblings. It is terrible that a young boy had to go through this experience, but it is just one example among many of armed citizens protecting themselves and the public from very bad people. I stood up for the Fourth and Fifth amendments during a filibuster a few weeks ago to address the president's constitutional authority to use drones against American citizens and the limits of executive power. Now I am prepared to protect the Second Amendment "right of the people to keep and bear arms." I stand ready to stand up for the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, as I will stand up for any other infringement of our Bill of Rights. Our rights are not subjected to polls. Whether it is popular or not popular, I took an oath to the Constitution, and I am prepared to stand with other senators or alone to protect the freedoms that our Founding Fathers fought to preserve.</text>

<title>In gun control debate, logic goes out the window - CNN.com</title>
<text>In gun control debate, logic goes out the window By Richard J. Davis, Special to CNN updated 1:52 PM EST, Sat January 26, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Richard Davis: Modest gun control proposals become focus of attacks He served in Carter administration, proposed firearm transaction database Even though plan wouldn't have listed gun owners, it was quickly shelved, he says Davis: Let's make sure reasonable steps don't fall victim to irrational opposition Editor's note: Richard Davis served as the assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement and operations during the Carter administration. He currently practices law in New York. CNN -- President Obama has decided to move ahead with a variety of gun control measures, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein has proposed a new assault weapons ban . While Washington debates new proposals on gun control, attention also needs to focus on obstacles to effective enforcement of existing gun laws, including the ban imposed by Congress on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives creating a federal database of firearms transactions. A discussion of the origin of that ban, which was initially enacted in response to a proposal made when I served as the assistant Treasury secretary overseeing the bureau, is useful to a better understanding of the dynamics of the debate over specific gun control proposals. Sadly, both then and now, logic often loses out. Richard Davis Early in 1978, the proposal we developed was relatively simple: Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers would file reports of sales of firearms with the bureau, but to avoid the argument that the bureau was impermissibly creating a national registry of gun owners, retailers would not be required to list the name of the retail purchaser. The rationale for creating a centralized firearms transaction database was twofold. First, it would speed up the ability to trace guns found at crime scenes, since even with the less sophisticated technology then available, such traces would still be able to be done virtually instantaneously. Gun control advocates march as nation reels from school shootings Second, and even more significant, it would allow the bureau to analyze the flow of firearms to identify potential diversions to the illegal gun market. For example, if a hundred handguns a week were going to one dealer in a small town in Virginia, that would suggest the possibility that guns were being sold illegally by that dealer to individuals smuggling them to New York or other states. By allowing this kind of analysis, the bureau could target investigative resources on dealers mostly likely to be violating the law. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter . We welcome your ideas and comments. Proceeding with what can only be described as youthful naiveté, the day the proposed regulations were published, I convened a briefing for interested parties, including the NRA and other anti-gun control groups. After all, none of these proposals would in any way alter the rules relating to gun ownership. The hope was that understanding the limited nature of the proposal would mute their opposition. I was very wrong. We had to withdraw the proposals, and Congress punitively reduced the bureau's budget and ultimately banned it from creating such firearms transaction databases. The opposition to the proposed regulations was intense, with opponents writing hundreds of thousands of often angry letters, both to Treasury and to members of Congress. Little of the opposition, however, focused on the actual proposals themselves. Bloomberg on guns and Sandy Hook shooting Parents of gun victims share goals King: Obama gun orders a political move One common thread to the opposition was the "slippery slope argument," which argued that the regulation would create a centralized list of all gun owners' names -- which it would not have done -- or would lead to the creation of such a list, which would then enable the government to seize everyone's weapons and put us on a path to dictatorship. Gun violence measures Would they work After all, it was argued, this is what the Nazis had done. Another often-used argument was that what we were proposing would not stop all criminals from securing or using firearms, and therefore it was not something worth doing. Arguments like these prevent an honest discussion of any proposal to address the problem of gun violence in America. The assumption that any regulation of firearms sets us on the path to confiscation of weapons is not only ludicrous on its face, it ignores all political reality. And, if the test for any proposal is whether it totally solves the problem being addressed, then no action would be taken addressing so many of society's important issues. Why require the use of seat belts if wearing a seat belt does not always save a life in an accident Why prohibit people from carrying guns onto planes if it doesn't eliminate all risk of hijacking Why prohibit providing assistance to terrorists if it doesn't stop all terrorist acts Why require tests for the issuance of driver's licenses if it doesn't stop all accidents We require these regulations because they address problems that need to be addressed and because if these regulations can save some lives, they are steps worth taking. So it should be with the gun debate. No proposal, or set of proposals, will ever stop all gun crime. But the 1978 proposals could have stopped some illegal sales of guns by renegade dealers. And things like forced waiting periods for gun purchases, requiring background checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and a ban on assault weapons would certainly save some lives. NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms Maybe it is thousands of lives over time; maybe it is hundreds. But isn't every life saved worth it Would it not have been worth it if even some of the lives lost at Sandy Hook could have been saved because the shooter did not have an assault weapon Gun control is not the total answer to the problem of mass shootings, but it plainly needs to be part of any meaningful response. Let's hope that this time the debate on gun control will be a more sensible one.</text>

<title>Activist: Farmer suicides in India linked to debt, globalization - CNN.com</title>
<text>Activist: Farmer suicides in India linked to debt, globalization By George Lerner, CNN One environmental activist claims the surge in suicides among India's farmers is related to a system of agriculture that has higher production costs than the farmer can cover with earnings. STORY HIGHLIGHTS An estimated 200,000 farmers have taken their own lives in India over the past 13 years Activist says it is due to ceding of control of the seed supply to the corporate chemical industry Activist says another factor is falling food prices in a global agricultural economy Columbia University professor claims surge in suicides not due to globalization policies RELATED TOPICS India CNN -- Thousands of poor farmers in India have committed suicide over the past decade as changes in India's agricultural policy set off a widening spiral of debt and despair, one environmental activist said Tuesday. "The farmer suicides started in 1997. That's when the corporate seed control started," Vandana Shiva told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "And it's directly related to indebtedness, and indebtedness created by two factors linked to globalization." For Shiva, who works with farming communities across India, those two factors were the ceding of control of the seed supply to the corporate chemical industry -- leading to increased production costs for already-struggling farmers -- as well as falling food prices in a global agricultural economy. An estimated 200,000 farmers have taken their own lives in India over the past 13 years, according to Indian government statistics. "The combination is unpayable debt, and it's the day the farmer is going to lose his land for chemicals and seeds, that is the day the farmer drinks pesticide," Shiva said. "And it's totally related to a negative economy, of an agriculture that costs more in production than the farmer can ever earn." But Columbia University Economics Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, a former adviser to the Indian government, said that globalization was not responsible for the surge of suicides among cotton farmers in the Indian states of Maharastra and Andhra Pradesh. "There are other states in India where cotton seeds have been absorbed and which are really prosperous. So you have to ask, why is it that these are breaking out" he asked. "What's happening is very much like the subprime mortgages in the United States, where a whole bunch of salesmen went out and sold mortgages to people who couldn't afford them." Share this on:</text>

<title>The myth of America's decline - CNN.com</title>
<text>The myth of America's decline By Rob Asghar, Special to CNN updated 3:51 PM EST, Thu November 17, 2011 Pam Bialecki installs carpet into a Jeep Liberty at the Toledo Assembly Complex this week in Toledo, Ohio. Chrysler Group LLC says it will add 1,100 jobs at the assembly complex. STORY HIGHLIGHTS The rapid growth of China and India does not mean the U.S. has fallen behind, Rob Asghar says Both face major environmental and infrastructural challenges within the next decade, he says Many East and South Asia societies are facing resistance to progress, Asghar says Asghar: U.S. may sabotage its tilt toward innovative growth if political dysfunction continues Editor's note: Rob Asghar is a Fellow at the University of Southern California's Center on Public Diplomacy and a member of the Pacific Council on International Policy. Los Angeles CNN -- China is poised to become the world's largest economy within a decade , according to some economists. Rising giant India already has a middle-class population that is larger than the entire United States population, according to others. Such nuggets fuel an industry of prophetic warnings of decline, exemplified by the phrase "How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented" in the subtitle of Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum's recent best-seller. The rapid growth of China and India and other Asian tigers does not mean that the United States has "fallen behind," however. It takes a panicked perspective to even ponder the point. China and India have immense economies, each with state-of-the-art technological centers that put others to shame. But they are also ranked 125th and 162nd, respectively , in GDP per capita according to the CIA's World Factbook, lacking clean water and safe food for too many citizens. Rob Asghar Both face massive environmental and infrastructural challenges within the next decade. Neither country is in range of providing an American level of services to its citizenry, much less the comfortable level typical of flourishing Northern European economies. And if we consider the deeper cultural dimensions of globalization and innovation, one could go so far as to argue that the globalization game is and will remain rigged in America's favor, with other nations not being able or even willing to catch up. In truth, many societies in East and South Asia are confronting ambivalence and resistance to developments that we might see as progress but that their traditionalists see as moral and social decline. Iran and Pakistan are just two examples of nations whose rapid modernization was undercut by underlying reactionary cultural forces. For related reasons, the various proud Asian tigers are not on an unbendable trajectory. Current trends are not destiny; it is more accurate to say that culture is destiny. Western academics may deride the "unoriginal" thinking of Chinese or Indian students, but this critique is based on an entirely different some would say culturally imperialistic worldview. Lao Tzu's "Tao Te Ching," still proudly full of wisdom today, stands as a reminder that disruption, individualism and innovation are inherently heretical in many traditional societies -- and if they occur in one area of a traditional society, a backlash typically follows in another. Gandhi's spirit, with its vigorous opposition to consumer capitalism, is hardly extinct. Meanwhile, America is the best at being America, because America is the closest thing to a society that unambivalently enjoys being American. The United States has cultural and demographic traits that remain unique -- for better and worse. American culture is peculiarly tilted toward valuing disruptive new ideas and welcoming the immigrant who brings such ideas into its society. An individualistic, heterogeneous, novelty-seeking American culture, strengthened by a critical mass of interdisciplinary American research universities that draw the world's best minds, represents a considerable edge in social and economic innovation. For today's emerging economies to become long-term giants, rather than variations of prerevolution Iran and the Soviet Union, they must become more economically and socially integrated. And to become economically integrated, they must become culturally integrated, which means a host of conflicts are on the horizon regarding varying societal views on change, tradition, materialism, social mobility, openness, patronage and so on. It will not be easy, and success is not inevitable. Many emerging nations are like a young child on the precipice of a tense and unpredictable adolescence. Eastern nations may in time become better than the West at the freewheeling socioeconomics that America and the rest of the West invented, but not without considerable social turmoil. A true taste for innovation and adaptation will result only from a vigorous clash between individualistic impulses and communitarian ones -- clashes that will take decades to play out, with uncertain outcomes. Americans may block their own path and sabotage their own cultural tilt toward innovative growth if political dysfunction continues. But with even some sensible reform of the political system, a resilient, forward-thinking and forward-moving economy should result. America was the key force in popping open the Pandoran box of commercial and cultural globalization, with all the attendant anxieties and unintended consequences. But the globalization game is an inherently American game, and it will take a great deal of luck, strategy and determination for someone else to play the game better than Americans are able to play it.

<text>9/18/09 One giant leap for globalization This summer marked the 40th anniversary of astronaut Neil Armstrong’s first steps on the moon. On July 21st 1969 he uttered the phrase, “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." There has been hours and hours of analysis about dropping the “a” as in one small step for a man, because it formed a grammatical contradiction. Armstrong said he hoped history would grant him some leeway and again further analysis suggests that the audio signal might have been interrupted during his historic walk. I am recalling that famous two and a half hour journey on the moon’s surface because today there is a spirited intellectual debate on whether the financial crisis of the past year will fundamentally change our approach to business, or be just an interruption on the path to globalization. During this month, nearly every strand of the crisis is being revisited to understand where we have been and what regulatory steps will emerge at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh. But, maybe we are missing the bigger picture. I have listened to astronauts talking about the mind-stretching image of looking at earth from space. One’s perspective, I am told, changes dramatically after such an experience and maybe that is what we should be doing ourselves right now -- looking not at what transpired in the past year or the decade that led to the asset bubble, but instead on the global puzzle being assembled. The smart minds are looking both forwards and back. Each year I spend a few days in the Alps with a group of German industrialists and businessmen to make sense of the world today. Last year, the talks took place just two days prior to the collapse of Lehman Brothers. I went back to look at what was said then and the analysis was incredibly prescient. The business community pointed to historic bank bailouts on a scale we have not seen before, more regulation of financial products by central banks leading to global rules and finally an effort to weed out the Madoffs of the world. The final point seems to be more difficult to police after the other well-known and recent examples of Enron, WorldCom and Tyco. The reality is one would never have dreamed of a $1.5 trillion deficit for the U.S., that Washington must drag around like a ball and chain for years to come. Europe and the U.S. are learning, much like Japan during the lost decade of the 1990s, the long-term implications of such a financial shock to the system. J.P. Morgan Chase bank released a study talking about a sizable lowering of the classic return on equity for banks from 15 percent down to 11 percent with higher capital requirements and stricter regulations. No doubt, banks will remain under the magnifying glass. But the Chief Financial Officer of Siemens, Joe Kaeser is suggesting something a bit different. His company has over 400,000 employees all over the world and only recently recovered from its own shock linked to compliance practices and kickbacks in 2006. Kaeser sees this crisis as the next big step for globalization. While the West is living on borrowed time and money, the economies of the East have re-grouped quickly. Many tried to debunk the decoupling of the East from the West, but with the divergence of growth we are witnessing today it is difficult to not believe in a higher grade of de-coupling and the bigger march towards further globalization. Eight, five and five -- those are the expected percentage annual growth rates for China, India and Indonesia for 2009 and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is confident that his $9 trillion stimulus plan will maintain that expansion through 2015. Oil in the $60-70 range should provide above average growth for the Middle East. Both China and the Middle East remain dependent on Europe and the U.S. for growth, but certainly less so than before. The next big step in globalization for the major industrial groups means to go where opportunity presents itself. GE for example recently landed a $2.5 billion deal to build power stations in Kuwait. Siemens secured a similar size contract for a water and power operation in Saudi Arabia a few years back. It may have felt like we all stepped off the cliff in September 2008, with many forced to ask the simple question, "Is my bank safe" Instead of winding the clock back a year, let’s take inspiration instead from Major General Armstrong and his historic words four decades ago.</text>

<title>Congressman charged with taking bribes around the world - CNN.com</title>
<text>Congressman charged with taking bribes around the world Story Highlights • William Jefferson faces 16 charges of bribery, obstruction, racketeering • Louisiana Democrat's schemes reached across Atlantic, prosecutors say • Investigators found $90,000 in Jefferson's home freezer • Search of Capitol Hill office prompted constitutional questions Adjust font size: WASHINGTON CNN -- Nearly two years after federal agents reported finding $90,000 in a freezer in his Washington home, U.S. Rep. William Jefferson has been charged with a global campaign to solicit bribes, obstruct justice and engage in racketeering, Justice Department officials said Monday. The veteran Louisiana Democrat faces 16 criminal counts, said Alice Fisher, assistant U.S. attorney general in the criminal division. "This case is about greed, power and arrogance," said Joe Persichini, director of the FBI's Washington field office, which led the investigation. In addition to the racketeering and solicitation charges, Jefferson has been charged with money laundering, wire fraud, conspiracy and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Map: Locations and details of Jefferson's charges "Congressman Jefferson is innocent. He plans to fight this indictment and clear his name," said Jefferson's attorney, Robert Trout. He said the "creative" indictment does not say Jefferson promised anyone legislative favors. Jefferson is the first U.S. official ever charged under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prohibits corporate bribery. The charges are based on 11 schemes in which Jefferson allegedly solicited bribes for himself and his family from government and business officials in the United States, Nigeria, Botswana, Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tome e Principe, U.S. Attorney Chuck Rosenberg said at an afternoon news conference. Watch prosecutors describe the alleged schemes "Mr. Jefferson corruptly traded on his good office and on the Congress where he served ... to enrich himself and his family through a pervasive pattern of fraud, bribery, and corruption that spanned many years and two continents," Rosenberg said. Jefferson sought millions of dollars in cash and company stock and received "somewhat less than $400,000," Rosenberg said. Jefferson has denied wrongdoing, and won a ninth congressional term in a December runoff despite the allegations. But the probe already has led to guilty pleas by a Kentucky businessman and a former aide to the congressman. Jefferson's homes in Washington and New Orleans were raided in August 2005. The following May, investigators raided his Capitol Hill office, sparking a furor among congressional leaders who argued the search violated the Constitution's separation of powers. Rosenberg said some documents seized in that search support the case. Fisher called the search "necessary, appropriate and constitutional." In court papers defending the 2006 search, investigators disclosed that they had found $90,000 in cash in the freezer of Jefferson's Washington home -- part of a $100,000 payment delivered by an informant in the bribery probe, according to federal agents. Jefferson will be arraigned and have the opportunity to enter a plea in federal court in Washington at 9 a.m. Friday, Rosenberg said. Conviction on all charges could bring a total of 235 years in prison. "There will be no plea bargain," Trout said. Fisher and Rosenberg denied that Monday's announcement was in any way affected by recent controversy surrounding the Justice Department and the firings of federal prosecutors. "Frankly, we don't give a damn about politics," Rosenberg said. "... We believe he broke the law. That's why we brought the charges. Period." The allegations against Jefferson emerged in the heat of the 2006 congressional election season, when Democrats were castigating House Republicans for tolerating what they called a "culture of corruption." After the raid on Jefferson's office, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi pushed Jefferson out of his seat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. But in February, Pelosi -- now speaker of the House -- agreed to place Jefferson on the Homeland Security Committee. The move drew criticism from Republicans, who accused Pelosi of backing away from promises to clean up Congress. Pelosi said the assignment was appropriate, given the committee's jurisdiction over matters related to Hurricane Katrina. The 2005 storm devastated Jefferson's district. CNN's Kevin Bohn and Kelli Arena contributed to this report. Tools:</text>

The article quoted local film-maker Jins Shamsudin as saying that the satellite television station's heavy use of foreign content could affect Malaysian viewers' patriotic spirit long term. The newspaper said that programs on Astro's four Chinese channels were "almost 100%" from Taiwan and Hong Kong, while its Tamil channel aired many shows from India. That was just the start. For over a week, nearly every day, headlines followed one after another. "Local Chinese regret Astro prefers Taiwan dramas." "Astro: Cabinet needs to discuss." Academics and literati worried in the reports that the imported programs were violent, failed to respect local sensitivities, and could harm morals and racial harmony. Politicians and officials weighed in to say the government should act. Then the controversy disappeared. Asiaweek Pictures Whatever reason Astro was targeted, Ananda Krishnan was caught in the crossfire What was that all about Try this. Utusan is linked to Malaysia's dominant political party, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's United Malays National Organization UMNO. UMNO is smarting from last November's general election, when it saw a drastic erosion of support in its core ethnic-Malay constituency. UMNO heavyweights are jockeying frantically ahead of the May party leadership polls. Utusan's attack focused on Astro's Chinese and Tamil channels, barely touching the other 23 channels which feature mostly Western content. Therefore Utusan's campaign was a way to fire up the Malay community ahead of the party polls. "This debate has to be seen in a wider context," media analyst Zaharom Nain wrote in the Internet newspaper Malaysiakini, "a context where the establishment . . . feels it needs to reassert itself as the champion of the Malays." Lim Kit Siang, chairman of the opposition Demo-cratic Action Party, is more direct. "[This] has to do with the upcoming UMNO Su-preme Council elections," he says. Certainly some of the comments about Astro had a rally-round-the-flag feel. UMNO Youth International Affairs Council chairman Abdul Azim Mohamed Zabidi said the government needs to restrict or reduce foreign programs on Astro, especially on the Chinese channels, which go against the norms and way of life of Malaysians. Remember those UMNO polls The party's 165 divisions are meeting and nominating candidates for various posts amid talk that UMNO needs a change. Mahathir's bid to retain the party presidency, which carries with it the premiership, looks safe. His only potential rival, Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, has so far been nominated for president by just one division out of the 50 needed to run Dr. M already has the nod from 47. But even one nomination raises eyebrows since the Supreme Council urged that Mahathir and his hand-picked heir, deputy premier Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, be nominated for president and deputy president without contest. So the race for No. 2 and below could be intense. But on second look, an Utusan campaign-UMNO polls link looks odd. When Malays deserted UMNO in droves in November, it was Chinese and other minority voters who helped the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition keep its two-thirds majority in Parliament. "[Mahathir] has been praising the minorities and talking of building a culture of Malaysian Malaysia," says Zaha-rom. "Now this comes out from his party-controlled newspaper, contradicting his earlier stand." Moreover, Astro, which reaches over 300,000 households, is part of Measat Broadcast Net-work Systems, controlled by T. Ananda Krishnan, a close friend of Mahathir and of Razaleigh. Ananda may be wondering if he somehow angered Dr. M, or if someone opposes his plan to list Measat on the U.S. Nasdaq market in June. Measat is also part of the Multimedia Super Corridor MSC, a project close to the PM's heart. Microsoft just bought 9% of the company. Critics say restricting Astro could hit investment in MSC. Senior Malaysian journalists say Dr. M did criticize Astro at an off-the-record briefing just before the Utusan campaign. But he aimed at Astro's Western news channels like CNN and CNBC, which he said were poisoning Malaysian minds with their promotion of globalization. So what lay behind Utusan Malaysia's campaign against Astro's Chinese and Tamil programming Not UMNO politics, says Sen. Zainuddin Maidin, deputy executive chairman of the daily's publisher, Utusan Melayu. "We had come to realize that people are watching Astro more than local programs," he says. "There were so many complaints from readers. It was not instilling a sense of nationalism." Okay. A television industry source says disgruntled local TV producers may have lit the fuse. Before the recession, Astro and its terrestrial rivals used many locally-produced programs. After the Crisis hit, they found that they could buy Hong Kong shows for as little as a quarter of the cost of Malaysian programs, and sharply cut their purchase of domestic content. Seems plausible. Still, the forum, timing and vehemence of the campaign remain curious. Sounds like the makings of a nice political thriller. With additional reporting by Arujua Ranawana/Kuala Lumpur</text>

<title>Appeals court rejects Virginia same-sex marriage ban - CNN.com</title>
<text>Appeals court rejects Virginia same-sex marriage ban By Bill Mears, CNN Senior Producer updated 1:48 AM EDT, Tue July 29, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS The ruling was another victory for gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed The decision was from a three-judge panel of the appeals court in Richmond Decision also affects bans in North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia NEW: Ruling can be appealed to full appeals court; could wind up at Supreme Court CNN -- A federal appeals court on Monday struck down Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage, the first such decision in a southern state and another victory for gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to legally wed. "We recognize that same-sex marriage makes some people deeply uncomfortable. However, inertia and apprehension are not legitimate bases for denying same-sex couples due process and equal protection of the laws," the divided three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit in Richmond concluded. Virginia strikes down gay marriage ban Virginia's same-sex marriage ban falls Court strikes down same-sex marriage ban The decision follows similar conclusions reached in recent weeks by another federal appeals court when tossing out bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Lower-court judges in a dozen states have also found voter-approved restrictions on the ability of same-sex couples to get married to be unconstitutional. The issue appears headed to the Supreme Court, eventually. The 4th Circuit opinion also will affect marriage laws in other states within its jurisdiction, including West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Only Maryland has legalized same-sex marriage. Separate orders would have to be issued for affected states in the region outside Virginia. Gay and lesbian couples in Virginia cannot marry in the state for at least another three weeks, giving the time for another appeal to be filed on enforcement. The Supreme Court will ultimately decide whether to review the constitutional issues pending in this case and those in several others, a process that may not begin at the earliest until later this year. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said he was "overjoyed" at the ruling. He and Virginia's attorney general have refused to defend the ban in court as is tradition, leaving it to other state officials to make the case. "This is a historic ruling for our commonwealth, and its effect will affirm once again that Virginia is a state that is open and welcoming to all," McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in a statement. A federal judge in February struck down Virginia's ban on constitutional grounds. The prohibition has effectively been in place since Colonial days, but only incorporated into the state's constitution in 2006. Victories for marriage equality supporters Monday's ruling continues a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year, giving marriage-equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved: striking all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. "The choice of whether and whom to marry is an intensely personal decision that alters the course of an individual's life," wrote Judge Henry Floyd in an opinion supported by Judge Roger Gregory. "Denying same-sex couples this choice prohibits them from participating fully in our society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the Fourteenth Amendment cannot countenance." In dissent, Judge Paul Niemeyer said the issue should not be in the hands of the courts. During May oral arguments, the three seemed to agree that both sides in the case were using the appeals court as "way-station up Interstate 95" to the Supreme Court. Byron Babione, senior counsel with the group Alliance Defending Freedom, said Niemeyer noted correctly, in its view, that there is "no fundamental right to same-sex marriage and there are rational reasons for not recognizing it," and that states must be permitted to have the final word. The group represents a plaintiff in defense of the ban, and is now weighing the next step. Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. Other cases in play A separate federal appeals court next month will hear separate challenges to same-sex marriage bans in the four states in its jurisdiction: Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The challenge to Virginia's ban was brought by several plaintiffs, including Timothy Bostic and Tony London of Norfolk. Two Richmond-area women, whose marriage was formalized in California, but is not recognized in the commonwealth also brought suit. Supporters of traditional marriage between one-man and one-woman have criticized the rulings in Virginia and other states, for expanding the right to homosexuals. Thirteen months ago, the Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume. More importantly, it also rejected parts of a federal law that had denied federal benefits, such as tax breaks, to same-sex spouses.

<text>Judges hear four states defend same-sex marriage bans By Bill Mears, CNN Senior Producer updated 5:42 PM EDT, Wed August 6, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Conservative judge expressed concerns about Michigan's same-sex ban Unusual series of oral arguments in a federal appeals courtroom in Ohio Gay rights supporters in the midst of legal winning streak CNN -- A prominent conservative judge expressed concerns Tuesday about whether Michigan's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage was constitutional, saying that given "modern conceptions of marriage," the state's law seems "harder to justify." The remarks came during an unusual series of oral arguments played out over one afternoon at the federal appeals court in Cincinnati. A three-judge panel 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heard lawyers from four states defend their same-sex marriage bans, in a dramatic series of consecutive cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Study: Kids of same-sex parents happier Court strikes down same-sex marriage ban Defrocked pastor reinstated In the first petition from Michigan, Judge Jeffrey Sutton had tough questions for the state's solicitor general. "What do we do about a reality that marriage -- it changes with social mores" asked Sutton from the bench. "And maybe, originally, marriage was about encouraging procreation ... but modern conceptions of marriage are more about love, affection, and commitment. And when you think of that way, it does seem a little harder to justify, even on rational basis grounds," he said. A winning streak Sutton, who was named to the court by President George W. Bush, added: "If you think about marriage just through that at lens — love, affection, commitment-- it does start to get gets a little difficult to see the difference between the one group eligible to marry and the other group not." The appeals panel could extend a remarkable winning streak for gay rights supporters, after state and federal judges in about two dozen cases have struck down same-sex marriage bans in the past year. This after the Supreme Court in June 2013 tossed out a key part of a federal law defining marriage as only between one man and one woman. Four separate rulings The current intermediate review stage will produce four separate written rulings in coming weeks. Appeals of one or all of those state bans will likely end up at the Supreme Court. There the justices could finally answer whether same-sex couples have a constitutional equal protection right that must be applied in every state, including the 31 with current bans. Federal appeals courts have already struck down similar bans in Utah, Oklahoma, and Virginia in recent weeks. Two of the three judges on the panel this week were appointed by Republican presidents, leading to predictions they would uphold state bans. The judicial panel was tough on both sides, particularly Sutton, who ask probing questions of lawyers representing various gay and lesbian couples seeking the right to wed, or to have their home states recognize valid out-of-state marriages. "If respect and dignity for gay couples are critical elements here, I would have thought the best way to get respect and dignity is through the democratic process," said Sutton, citing those states that have chosen to change the law in the past decade. Conservative argument He suggested taking the challenge in the courts was not the best strategy. "Don't you think you're more likely to change hearts and minds through the democratic process, than you are with the decision of five justices on the Supreme Court Assuming you can win on this, why do you want that route" he asked. That has been the argument many conservative activists have made in preserving the marriage status quo. Michigan's Solicitor General Aaron Lindstrom defended the current ban, saying "It's rational for the state to have an interest in promoting marriage, so it will be more likely a child will have both a mother and father, and will have the benefits of having both a mother and a father. But Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey, named to the bench by President Clinton, jumped in. "But what is the rational basis of excluding everybody else It doesn't interfere with the procreation of children just because you've got two people of the same sex marrying in and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate." Complete discretion And when Lindstrom said the state had an interest ensuring "procreation occurs in long-term committed relationships between opposite sex couples," the judge seemed unconvinced. "Isn't that a little hypocritical," said Daughtrey, "to allow people to marry who can't procreate, but prevent same sex partners from marrying, and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate" The nine members of the high court have complete discretion to accept or deny any case presented to them. Their recent precedents however, give unbridled optimism to many in the gay rights and civil rights communities they will at least get their day in court. A sweeping judicial victory may be tantalizingly close. "You never know how any Supreme Court case is going to be resolved, especially when the stakes are this high, but the challengers definitely have the upper hand," said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney. Also argued Tuesday was Kentucky's ban. The commonwealth's Democratic Gov. Steven Beshear hired outside lawyers to defend the ban on recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages, after his attorney general tearfully refused in March to take part in any further legal challenges. More than 70 lawsuits By CNN's count, there are more than 70 same-sex marriage lawsuits pending in every state with a current ban. North Dakota this spring becoming the latest, and last, to have one filed in court, on behalf of seven homosexual couples. The Supreme Court could historically alter how marriage is treated under a legal framework, potentially striking down every current same-sex marriage ban. Or the justices could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures and state courts to sort it all out, for now. A CNN/ORC International poll released a year ago found an apparent cultural shift-- 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. And that survey showed 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages.</text>

<text>Methodists drop church charges against minister who conducted gay wedding By Rande Iaboni, CNN updated 8:48 AM EDT, Wed March 12, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS The Rev. Thomas Ogletree officiated at his son's same-sex marriage in 2012 Church policy bars such marriages in Methodist churches or being performed by ministers A fellow clergyman filed a complaint against Ogletree The UMC says there will be no church trial against Ogletree CNN -- The United Methodist Church announced Monday it is dropping its denominational case against a New York clergyman who officiated his son's same-sex wedding. The Rev. Thomas Ogletree was charged by the church after presiding over the wedding of his son to another man on October 20, 2012, according to a statement from the New York Annual Conference NYAC of the United Methodist Church. The Methodist church says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation, but same-sex marriages cannot be performed in Methodist churches or by ordained ministers under church policy. An official church trial was set for Ogletree, in which his case would have been heard by a jury of 13 ordained clergy members with a penalty ranging from a reprimand to a full defrocking. Following an additional meeting among the church counsels, the decision was made to reach a "just resolution agreement" instead of a trial, said the statement. "Church trials produce no winners," NYAC Bishop Martin McLee said in a statement Monday, stating that such prosecutions result in "harmful polarization and continue the harm brought upon our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters." The case began when a fellow clergyman who had seen the wedding announcement for Ogletree's son in The New York Times filed a complaint with the bishop of the conference, according to the statement. The complaint set in motion a formal disciplinary process with McLee, who then referred the case to counsel for the church, the equivalent of a prosecutor. After the case was reviewed, it was determined that there was sufficient evidence to warrant charges against Ogletree for his violations, the statement said. "I could not with any integrity as a Christian refuse my son's request to preside at his wedding," Ogletree said in a statement in January. "It is a shame that the church is choosing to prosecute me for this act of love," the January statement said. Ogletree is a retired professor and a past dean of the Yale Divinity School. As part of Monday's resolution, Ogletree agreed to join others from varying perspectives in a public forum that "shall reflect a variety of different opinions and understandings," according to the just resolution agreement. Ogletree released a statement Monday relinquishing his right to the trial and accepting McLee's intention to "approach the matter of marriage equality in a non-juridical manner." The decision comes just months after Pennsylvania pastor, Frank Schaefer, was defrocked in December after being found guilty in a church trial for officiating his own son's same-sex wedding . "On first blush it doesn't seem fair," Schaefer said on Monday, "two United Methodist Ministers are charged with the exact same 'crime' of officiating at their son's same sex weddings -- one is defrocked, the other one's case is dropped without conditions." Schaefer went on to say that despite the different outcomes, overall he is happy about the church's decision to drop Ogletree's case. "It is a victory for the LGBT movement...if trials are part of the reason why things are changing now in the United Methodist church, it will have been worth my sacrifice," Schaefer said.</text>

<title>Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? - CNN.com</title>
<text>Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN updated 6:10 PM EST, Sun February 9, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Political reaction to more federal recognition of same-sex marriages to all states muted A Republican strategist said Republicans' views on the issue are changing Some LGBT activists want more action from the Obama administration Washington CNN -- Same-sex marriage is a non-issue in American politics. OK, that might be a bit of an overstatement, but it seems to be causing less of a firestorm lately than when it was a dependable wedge issue. When Attorney General Eric Holder announced Saturday at the Human Rights Campaign's gala that the federal government will expand the recognition of same-sex marriages in federal legal matters, including bankruptcies, prison visits and survivor benefits, it barely moved the political crisis dial. The Twitter world was relatively quiet. News releases from both Republicans and Democrats were few and far between. The topic was barely mentioned on the Sunday political talk shows. The biggest fallout might be more about President Obama's use of executive action to push his agenda rather than the issue itself. DOJ extends recognition of gay marriage W.H. to recognize Utah gay marriages Utah pushes pause on same-sex marriages 2013: The year gay rights 'triumphed' It's not that this announcement isn't a big deal, because "it's a very big deal," said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic donor and former campaign manager for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. Although Holder's announcement is an extension of the Supreme Court's decision last year striking down the Defense of Marriage Act, it's a definitive statement on the Obama administration's policy position. "Just like during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the stakes involved in this generation's struggle for LGBT equality could not be higher," Holder said Saturday. "As attorney general, I will not let this department be simply a bystander during this important moment in history." Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation" that the announcement is "logical, it's consistent, it's passionate." But one day after Holder's announcement, conservatives, who tend to oppose same-sex marriage, have said little. Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire said on CBS News' "Face the Nation" that it "appears to be another example of the Obama administration imposing its will on the states" and noted that same-sex marriage is legal in her state. It "could" be an issue in other states where it is not, she said. That's not exactly a seething denouncement. The issue has come a long way in the court of public opinion, as a majority of Americans now support same-sex marriage. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll from September, 56% of Americans support marriage for same-sex couples, compared with only 25% who supported it in 1996. A CNN poll in 2010 was the first time a poll found that a majority of respondents backed it. Republican strategist Ana Navarro said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" that opinions on same-sex marriage represent the "most rapid social change that we've seen in our lifetime." Navarro said Republican politicians' positions are evolving, too, but they aren't too vocal about it. She said Republican views on the issue are changing rapidly, but politicians "may not be out there because there's no reason to take the political hit if there's no legislation in front of them." The political hit could come from the party base, among whom opposition is more common. The same Quinnipiac poll found that 36% of Republicans back same-sex marriage in their states. Navarro insisted, however, that opinions are changing quickly among Republican voters and that by the 2016 presidential election, it might be "much less of a point than it is today." The last five years have seen a tremendous amount of change on the issue. More than a dozen states have legalized same-sex marriage, and Obama is the first president to endorse it. Support for gay rights generally has increased, as evidenced late last year when the Senate passed the Employment Non-Discrimination Act , which would outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace. It was the first time the Senate had passed the measure, and it won 10 Republicans votes. Republican strategist John Feehery, president of QGA Communications, said: "There is so much else the Republican Party should focus on. I imagine that they won't spend much time pounding away at this issue." Elmendorf said the administration's decision was not a political risk for Obama or the Democrats leading into the 2014 midterm elections. "There's not a political downside for Obama. There's none," he said. Elmendorf noted that gay rights' issues in politics are no longer a niche issue but rather appeal to many voters. "It's not about gay voters any more, it's about any voter under the age of 40," he said. Rand Paul warns his former home state, Texas, could turn blue Not everyone has stayed out of the fray, however. Former Arkansas governor and potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who also appeals to social conservatives, sent an e-mail to his supporters shortly after Holder's announcement. "Is it a surprise this administration is picking and choosing the laws they like" the e-mail read. It included included a link to the CNN story about Holder's announcement and asked for support of Huckpac, his political action committee, and the Conservative Candidates fund. Same-sex marriage could become a campaign issue in some of the more conservative districts and states around the country, where incumbents could face challenges from the right, especially in the more than two dozen states that have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage. A Republican operative said people could "probably see this as another overreach by the Obama administration to subvert their will." Even Obama's evolution on the issue, from opposing same-sex marriage to supporting it, still has not satisfied LGBT activists and supporters. For one, he has not indicated that same-sex marriage should be addressed at the federal level to eliminate the patchwork of laws around the country. While reaction might be much more muted, for proponents, the issue is far from won.</text>

<text>Do you favor or oppose a flat-tax system if the new system: Favor Taxed all Americans at a flat rate of 17% 41% Eliminated all tax deductions for state and local taxes 35% Taxed wages not profits from the sales of stocks/real estate 34% Eliminated the tax deduction for charitable contributions 31% Eliminated all tax deductions for home mortgages 29% Increased the size of the federal budget deficit 11% 82% From a telephone poll of 800 adult Americans taken for TIME/CNN on Jan. 17-18 by Yankelovich Partners Inc. Sampling error is plus/minus 3%. "Not sures" omitted. But the spareness of Forbes' flat tax is deceptive. Yes, taxpayers would pay a single rate on their income above a certain threshold: for example, above $36,000 for a family of four. And families below that threshold would pay no income tax. But it is almost impossible to sort out fully the economic burdens that would result from the system's new rules. This much seems clear: the scheme Forbes is pushing in his television ads looks as if it would either swell the federal deficit or raise taxes on middle Americans while bestowing extra riches on the rich. The public fascination with Forbes' plan is based on at least one large misconception: "People think that the flat tax, by closing loopholes, will make the rich pay more," populist Republican analyst Kevin Phillips observes. Voters sometimes bluntly tell Forbes that they like his tax plan because it would ensure that rich people like him, with fancy lawyers and lobbyists and accountants, paid at least as much as the average taxpayer. In fact the rich already pay more. The Joint Committee on Taxation, which is controlled by Republicans in Congress, says the best-paid 1% of Americans, who declare more than $219,770 in annual income, fork over 27% of it to the irs, in contrast to 5% paid by Americans earning the median income of $32,364. Forbes says he knows these numbers. But rather than correct his supporters, he nods and flashes that endearing smile. As Forbes readily concedes when he is questioned, his flat tax would deliver a double windfall to the wealthy: it would slash taxes on top salaries more than a third and eliminate taxes on savings and investments, including dividends, interest on savings, capital gains, inheritances and Social Security benefits. A family earning $1 million a year, for example, would save $168,836 in taxes under the Forbes plan--a cut of 68%. Pollster Frank Luntz, who market-tested the House Republicans' Contract with America, says his surveys and focus groups show that middle Americans don't mind if the wealthy get a tax break as long as they get one too. Forbes agrees, and claims, "Everyone gets a tax break with the flat tax." But if that's true, the flat tax would collect less money than the current system, at least in the short term. Robert Hall, a conservative Stanford University economist, who with his colleague Alvin Rabushka literally wrote the book on the subject The Flat Tax, 1985, estimates that Forbes' scheme would widen the federal deficit by $182 billion a year--just when a majority of voters in both parties say they want a balanced budget before new tax cuts. Forbes, a believer in the quasi-theology called supply-side economics, assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit. He paints a vision of wealthy investors shifting their money out of T-bills and into new factories and inventions. It may not have worked that way in the 1980s, when top tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-siders are often described as optimists. Though he generally holds that "the deficit is not our biggest problem" and declines to specify spending he would cut, Forbes has taken to hedging his supply-side bet. He now asserts that a Republican Congress is far more likely to cut spending, especially on the military now that the cold war is over. Still, even conservative economists and tax experts say middle-class Americans are not likely to make out as well under the Forbes plan as he promises. To raise as much revenue as the current tax system, the Hall-Rabushka plan starts at a 19% tax rate, 2 points higher than Forbes', and exempts much less income from taxation--$25,000 instead of $36,000. Hall and Rabushka estimate that under their proposal, taxpayers with incomes between $30,000 and $90,000 would pay slightly more in income taxes than they do now. That is in part because an unavoidable cost of the simplicity of a single-rate tax is lower tax collections from the wealthy, and that revenue must be recouped somewhere. In their plan, and in Forbes', the nonrich would probably lose in other ways as well. Because most businesses, shorn of special tax breaks, would face higher effective tax rates, they would probably pass along that cost as higher consumer prices. Denied a tax break for employer-provided health insurance, companies would either curtail those benefits or reduce wages. And under Forbes' plan, there would be no relief from the biggest tax burden that faces most workers: the 15.3% Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Forbes' rise in the polls has led to a case of me-tooism among his G.O.P. rivals, several of whom quickly announced their flat-tax plans last week even while attacking Forbes' scheme as favoring, in Pat Buchanan's barb, "the boys down at the yacht basin." Buchanan and Senator Phil Gramm offered single-rate tax plans that would retain the popular deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions and would tax investment income. A long-shot candidate, self-made tire magnate Morry Taylor, asks why Forbes would charge him nothing on the $15 million he collected last year in stock profits but charge his workers full tax on their wages. Says Taylor: "It's nuts." In this highly charged debate, a commission chaired by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp a Forbes mentor last week ducked almost all specifics even while endorsing the idea of a single-rate flat tax. Meanwhile, tax reformers with other ideas are also stirring. Another G.O.P. presidential hopeful, Senator Richard Lugar, is pushing a national sales tax, which he says would allow him to abolish the irs while scooping up billions of dollars in unreported income from drug dealers and others who now don't pay income taxes--but do buy cars and groceries subject to a sales tax. The downside is that to raise as much money as the income tax, a national sales tax would reach a staggering 20%--a level that in other countries has prompted elaborate evasion schemes.

<title>AllPolitics - Tax Code Reform Heats Up - April 13, 1998</title>
<text>Tax Code Reform Heats Up Three top reform proposals argue for radical change By Sue Hoye/AllPolitics WASHINGTON April 13 -- There are plenty of tax code proposals floating around Capitol Hill, but all of them focus on two central ideas: fairness and simplicity. Suggested changes range from completely abolishing the IRS and the income tax to creating a flat tax with no deductions. Some consider both these proposals too regressive and have proposed a graduated flat tax that takes into account income levels when determining tax rates. That is to say, the higher your income, the higher your tax rate. Here are three of best-known and most hotly debated tax code bills before Congress: Flat Tax Proposal Rep. Dick Armey R-Texas and Sen. Richard Shelby R-Ala. are the House and Senate proponents of a flat tax. Under their proposal, the current graduated income tax would be phased out over a three-year period and replaced by a 17 percent flat tax on all businesses and individuals. There would be no deductions or credits. Proponents claim that pre-tax personal exemptions would be increased to help protect low-income families from an undue tax burden. As proposed, a single person would receive an exemption on the first $11,600 of income. A married couple filing jointly would receive a $23,200 exemption. A $5,300 exemption would be allotted for each dependent child. According to U.S. Treasury data, a flat tax would cut taxes by $30 billion in the first year. Rigid spending caps are also part of the bill, which shares the goal of balancing the budget by 2002. The bill numbers for a flat tax are H.R.1040 for the House and S.1040 for the Senate. Standard Deduction Personal Exemption: $5,300 National Sales Tax Plan Rep. Dan Schaefer R-Colo. and Rep. Billy Tauzin R-La. introduced the National Retail Sales Tax Act to the House in 1997. The sales tax plan would impose a 15 percent tax on all "the gross payments for the use, consumption or enjoyment in the United States of any taxable property or service, whether produced or rendered within or without the United States." As proposed, the national sales tax would be administered by the states, not the IRS. The tax would operate much like a state sales tax, meaning it would be added to the cost of an item at the time of purchase. The language of the bill suggests the abolishment of the current IRS and the creation of a smaller tax bureau to collect trust fund excise taxes, like the gasoline tax. The Social Security Administration would enforce and collect payroll taxes. According to the proposal, the sales tax rate would decline in the future to 12 or 10 percent with the growth of the economy and a reduction in spending. The bill number is H.R. 2001. The 10 Percent Plan House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt D-Mo. has proposed a plan calling for five new tax brackets with rates ranging from 10 percent to 34 percent. According to Gephardt, this plan would reduce the tax bills of more than three of every five Americans. Specifically, Gephardt's plan calls for a 10 percent taxation on the first $23,000 of an individual's income, and 10 percent levy on the first $46,000 of a married couple's income. From there rates would progress to 20, 26, 32 and 34 percent. This plan preserves the deduction of interest on home mortgages. The bill number for Gephardt's plan is H.R. 3620.

<title>Opinion: Ben Carson, admirable man with a mistaken philosophy - CNN.com</title>
<text>Ben Carson, admirable man with a mistaken philosophy By Cynthia Tucker, Special to CNN updated 8:44 AM EDT, Tue March 26, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Cynthia Tucker: Republicans are desperate for more high-profile black candidates She says they have swooned over Ben Carson, a renowned surgeon who rose from poverty Carson has a great life story but puts too much faith in the power of self-reliance, she says Tucker: Many Americans realize that outside forces also determine success or failure Editor's note: Cynthia Tucker, a Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist, is a visiting professor at the University of Georgia's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. CNN -- Like giddy teenagers, Republican activists have fallen for another charming, personable and accomplished black conservative. Dr. Ben Carson is the newest object of their crush, which was born of a desperate need to attract more black men and women as high-profile standard-bearers. You can't blame Republican loyalists for swooning over the doc, a renowned surgeon who rose from poverty to head pediatric neurosurgery at Baltimore's famed Johns Hopkins Hospital. If wooing voters of color were simply a matter of finding an attractive black face with an inspiring personal story and an impressive resume, Carson would be hard to beat. But black voters tend to be more discerning than that. They have shown an unerring instinct for rejecting condescension and dismissing tokenism. There are many black Americans who admire Carson for his professional accomplishments I'm one of them, but that admiration is unlikely to translate into votes. Cynthia Tucker One of the reasons is that Carson doesn't seem to know black Americans' political values very well. In his most recent book -- a political tract called "America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great" -- he writes: "Many African-Americans voted for Obama simply because he was a black man and not because they resonated philosophically with his policies." In fact, black voters have been increasingly allied with the Democratic Party since the 1960s when Lyndon Johnson pushed through significant civil rights legislation. Al Gore received about 95% of the black vote in 2000, John Kerry about 93% in 2004. Moreover, Carson seems to have adopted the view, popular among so many ultra-conservatives, that the Democratic Party appeals to voters who shun the work ethic. Talking to The New York Times recently about his conservative views, Carson described himself as a "flaming liberal" in college who later became disaffected with the Democratic Party. "One thing I always believed strongly in was personal responsibility and hard work," he said. "I found the Democrat Party leaving me behind on that particular issue." Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion and follow us @CNNOpinion on Twitter . We welcome your ideas and comments. That notion -- fallacious though it is -- is at least as popular among black conservatives as among white ones. I've been hearing it from black Republicans for at least two decades. Several years ago, I interviewed a black conservative running a doomed campaign for a suburban Atlanta congressional district. She had no prior political experience, no policies to advance, no program to sell. Her platform consisted of her belief in hard work, which she contrasted, at least implicitly, with black Democrats' supposed preference for sloth. That view is as puzzling as it is infuriating. It may charm those white conservatives who hold stereotypical views of black Americans, but it bears little resemblance to the realities that inform their choices at the ballot box. In his memoir, "Gifted Hands," and in his motivational speeches, Carson talks about his impoverished childhood and his remarkable semiliterate mother. Married at 13 only to later divorce her philandering husband, she enforced high academic standards for Carson and his brother while working two or three jobs as a maid or nanny -- and battling debilitating depression. Dr. Ben Carson: A new voice in politics Carson eventually got into Yale and became, at 33, the youngest person to head a department at Johns Hopkins Hospital. He is famous for separating conjoined twins. That's a compelling and powerful tale. But it differs from those of other hardworking black people I know only in the degree of success that Carson attained as a result, not in the measures of ambition, industriousness, discipline and self-respect his mother instilled in her children. Yet black Americans know better than to believe those traits are enough to guarantee success. History taught us better. Just look back over the last decade and a half. In 2000, according to the U.S. census, less than a quarter of black Americans -- 22.5% -- lived in poverty. By 2010, that number had risen to 27.4%. Was there a sudden outbreak of indolence among black folk over that period Or were there outside forces that conspired to knock them back down the economic ladder As long as the Republican Party refuses to acknowledge that, it will have little to offer workers of color -- and declining appeal to younger whites. They, too, understand the limits of self-reliance. To be helpful to the GOP, Carson would have to remind them of the caprice of capitalism and the generational reach of racism's barriers. Instead, he sounds like the standard-issue Ayn Rand acolyte, no different from Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan. He opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and supports a flat tax. For good measure, he's also a religious conservative who disputes evolution. It's no wonder that conservatives have started to trumpet him as their Great Black Hope. Psychologists believe that romantic interest increases when people mirror each other's gestures. Carson perfectly reflects the beliefs of his suitors. Still, this romance is unlikely to blossom into a long-lasting love affair. There are too many misunderstandings, too many unspoken expectations, too many half-baked assumptions. And some of those half-based assumptions are Carson's.</text>

<title>AllPolitics - The Great Tax Bazaar - July 31, 1997</title>
<text>What We Didn't Find At The Great Tax Bazaar By Charles Bierbauer/CNN WASHINGTON July 31 -- By the time they were done there was something in the tax cuts for just about everyone. Well, maybe not if you have no spouse, kids or house. But, hey, this is politics. President Bill Clinton stretched the $500-per-child credit to reach low-income working families. Republicans rewarded long-term investors with capital gains rates as low as 18 percent. In between, middle-class Americans who were ostensibly to be the prime benefactors of the tax cuts got kid credits, college tuition breaks and broader access to IRA accounts. By the time the tax cut negotiators were done, though, the happiest people were the tax accountants. Tax time is going to be more complicated. "That's where people like me come in and are happy the new tax law looks like it is going to go into effect," says tax attorney Joel Weingarten. "Rather than simplifying things, there is an added layer of calculations, information record keeping, that sort of thing." American taxpayers may like the better bottom line they are likely to find on their 1997 tax returns. They won't like getting there. Ironically, it may force more low-income families to spend their money on tax preparers. One of the more complex formulas which will have to be sorted out is the one which integrates the child credit with the Earned Income Tax Credit now received by families with lower incomes. "The forms for the Earned Income Tax Credit are 27 pages in the instruction booklet, and already we have people of low income that should be doing 1040EZ on their weekend are now taking it to H&R Block," says House Majority Leader Dick Armey. The Texas Republican says that's one of the "real shames" of the tax code. One tax accountant tells me EITC recipients are even more likely to seek cheap help -- somebody's cousin, a moonlighting neighbor, Joe's Towing and Taxes -- and get bad advice. Tax preparers now await the arrival of what they call "Package X" -- their annual forms and instructions from the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS says it's at work on an approximately 100-page plan, rewriting its computer programs, gearing up its training sessions. "I'll be going back to school, taking some seminars," says tax attorney Weingarten. "I don't have too much hair left to pull out." It was the politicians more than the taxpayers who were clamoring for these tax cuts. What taxpayers say they'd most like is a simpler tax filing process. This is not it. "None of this changes the pressures to throw the entire income tax out," says Rep. Bill Archer, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Archer means real tax reform, not tax cut tinkering. Tax legislation starts in his committee. Archer favors some form of consumption tax on what we spend, not what we earn. Armey, on the other hand, has long touted a flat tax -- one 17 percent rate for everyone -- that could be filed on a post card-sized form. "My flat tax proposal is still alive and well with the American people and it's on its way to becoming the law of the land before I retire from Congress," Armey says. Armey is, however, only 57. He is in his seventh term in the House, and there are no term limits. For now, just getting taxes cut for the first time in nearly two decades has been arduous enough for Congress and the White House for now. "It won't happen next year, but I think it will be a significant issue in the campaigns next year and we'll have an opportunity in 1999," says Archer. Two years ago the chairman told me the opportunity would come in 1997. "We've got a president who isn't sold on the idea, and we've got to work toward getting him in the right frame of mind to understand how much this will do for the country," Archer adds. No future partisanship should diminish the current accomplishment, though. Skeptics had plenty of opportunity to doubt it would come about. Even after the parallel celebrations Tuesday on the White House lawn and Capitol steps, there were changes still being made and others sought. President Clinton threw in a late veto threat if families were allowed to withdraw IRA savings to pay private school tuitions through high school, rather than college. The provision was pulled. Archer says he headed off other post-agreement changes. But he also says this is "just the beginning." "We look forward to building on it in the next Congress, particularly while the economy continues to improve and revenues increase," says Archer. "If we can keep the breaks on spending, we should have room for another tax reduction next year." Of course, it won't be simple getting there. And it won't be simple figuring it out on the tax forms. Tax accountants can count on that. It makes them happy even it baffles the rest of us. Click here for technical help or to send us feedback . Copyright © 1997 AllPolitics All Rights Reserved.

<title>AllPolitics - Same Time, Next Year - April 18, 1997</title>
<text>Join a thread, start a thread -- it's your chance to sound off! Same Time, Next Year By Charles Bierbauer/CNN WASHINGTON April 17 -- The checks are in the mail. Owed the IRS a bit this year. Now that April 15 has come and gone dare we comfortably put the terrors of tax day behind us Not if we're smart. Any tax expert will tell you the time to start next year's tax planning is yesterday. You can tuck a little away in an IRA. Store some more in a 401-K. Put a little aside in the kids' accounts. Not too much, though, or the IRS will tax theirs just as steeply as yours. And you'll worry the kids might spend it as frivolously as the government. Still, there's only so much you can do to curb your own tax bill. The real problem with planning for next year's taxes is knowing now what next year's tax law will look like. Is there any real chance Congress and the Clinton Administration might do anything to actually make paying taxes less painful, less complicated, less costly You might have thought so listening to the people's representatives on April 15: "Today is dreaded tax day." -- Rep. Joseph Pitts R-Pa. "Some say it takes a village to raise a child, but it takes a village idiot to raise taxes on working families." -- Rep. Tom DeLay R-Texas "Milk the cow, but don't pull off the udder." -- Rep. Chip Pickering R-Miss. "It's time to take a cue from Lorena Bobbit. It's time to slash." -- Rep. Joel Hefley R-Colo. If only there were a tax on bad rhetoric. We could balance the budget in no time. So what has Congress actually done to ease our pain and payments Assuming, of course, you think Americans are overtaxed. We could be paying Swedish rates. The politicians must think so. President Bill Clinton and the Republican leaders all want tax cuts, though not the same cuts. Well, here's what all the great symbolism and not-so-great rhetoric produced on tax day. The House voted on three tax-related measures. The Senate voted on one. Don't hold your breath. -- A bill to amend the Constitution to require a two-thirds majority of Congress to raise taxes fell short in the House. Just the latest of a spate of constitutional amendments to be rejected, most deservedly. -- The House passed a sense of Congress vote saying Americans deserve tax relief. It won't actually save anyone a dime. Thanks, guys and gals. Feel better -- The House and Senate passed similar bills making it a crime for IRS employees to "browse" through their computers and snoop in our tax files without authorization. This measure actually counts. It's a tool the tax collection agency wanted to curb the curiosity of its employees and allow it to dismiss the nosy ones. The taxing business still lies ahead if we are to see any significant changes. It's part structural, part fiscal, part philosophical. Building a Better Bureaucracy The National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service is leaning toward urging a more independent IRS with greater public oversight, perhaps a civilian review board. For some reason, the Clinton administration's Treasury Department has recently warmed toward embracing its wayward stepchild. Some commission members see that as a Johnny-come-lately acceptance of Treasury responsibility and suggest it's too late. "Take the leadership away from Treasury," says one commission member. Another suggests there has to be a message to the IRS, too: "Answer the phones, and don't blame everything on the computers!" The commission, which will issue its report early this summer, is also headed toward reminding Congress that a lot of the IRS problems are driven by the way Congress has written the rules. What Ever Happened to Tax Reform House Majority Leader Dick Armey R-Texas, is still touting his 17 percent "flat tax" as the way to go. File it on a post card. Make tax day a breeze. Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, also a Texas Republican, still wants to "tear the tax code out by its roots" and uproot the IRS as well. For several years now, Archer has been urging some form of consumption tax, either a national sales tax or a value-added tax of the sort collected in much of Europe. For all his rumination, though, Archer has not yet decided which he likes. Other proposals bob up from time to time on Capitol Hill, some flatter, some fatter. The Clinton Administration this week proposed some 60 changes in IRS procedures to make filing simpler. Genuine tax reform, though, is not on this year's calendar. "It won't happen as long as Clinton is president," says Republican Armey, putting the partisan KO on the subject. What might happen will take a bipartisan punch. A Balanced Budget and a Tax Cut, Too! One of comedian Chevy Chase's old Saturday Night Live routines advertised a wondrous product that was both a "floor wax and a dessert topping!" Congressional and administration budget negotiators are trying to recreate that stomach-turning combination. Their alchemy counts on balancing the budget while the federal government both takes in less tax revenue and spends less. And all it takes is the correct formula. Some common ground exists within unequal parameters. -- Both sides propose a $500 per child tax credit for middle income families. But what's middle income -- Democrats have allowed there could be some reduction of capital gains taxes, though not as broadly as Republicans would like. Clinton would expand the exemption for profits on home sales. Republicans want to halve the 28 percent maximum capital gains rate. -- Republicans want to cut -- ideally, eliminate -- estate taxes. -- Democrats say there must be movement on education towards Clinton's tuition tax credits. A balanced budget deal is the best bet for tax relief. At this point, taxpayers, don't count on anything. Nothing is certain until the whole budget package is locked in. Except, of course, April 15, 1997. Mark your calendars. Same time, next year. Click here for technical help or to send us feedback . Copyright © 1997 AllPolitics All Rights Reserved.

<title>House Democrats vent on tax plan, focus criticism on estate tax - CNN.com</title>
<text>House Democrats vent on tax plan, focus criticism on estate tax From Deirdre Walsh, CNN Congressional Producer Sen. Sherrod Brown on Obama: 'Sellout' STORY HIGHLIGHTS House Democrats at a closed-door meeting vent on Obama's tax proposal They complain of being left out of final negotiations And they gripe that the administration agreed too quickly on an estate tax proposal "My sense is people are not happy with this," says one Democratic member Washington CNN -- House Democrats vented their frustrations with President Barack Obama's tax proposal at a closed-door meeting Tuesday night, with rank-and-file members slamming the White House for leaving House Democrats out of final negotiations, and agreeing too quickly to a GOP proposal on the estate tax. According to several Democratic members and aides, much of the discussion centered on the addition of the estate tax exemption to the package extending all the Bush-era tax cuts for two years. Democrats are fuming that the administration agreed to exempt inheritances up to $5 million and to set the tax rate at 35%. The estate tax is scheduled to be reinstated at a higher rate of 55% next year, with the exemption up to $1 million. A bill passed the House a year ago that set the threshold for the exemption at $3.5 million and the tax rate at 45%. Pennsylvania Democrat Allyson Schwartz said, "My sense is people are not happy with this," telling reporters that Democrats plan to "push back at little" at the White House to try to change the estate tax back to the version that passed the House. Schwartz said if the administration agreed to do that, she could support the package, but she could not predict how many other Democrats would do the same. Spitzer grills White House on tax deal How might the poor fare in tax cut deal Obama defends deal on taxes Explain it to me: Bush-era tax cuts RELATED TOPICS Democratic Party Liberal Democratic Rep Anthony Weiner of New York called the estate tax provision "one of the biggest problems, because that was the one we had the most leverage on." According to a senior House Democratic aide, Democratic Rep Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who represented House Democrats in discussions with the administration and Republicans, said the decision to accept the GOP estate tax proposal was "an unnecessary giveaway to Kyl." GOP Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona, who was negotiating for Senate Republicans, sponsored an estate tax bill that is essentially the same as the deal outlined by Obama. About 20 House Democrats lined up at microphones at the evening meeting to complain about the president's proposal. According to the senior Democratic aide, in addition to concerns about the substance of the proposal, equally upsetting to attendees was how "House Democrats were left out of the process at the end." The aide added, "they view it as a trend," noting that it started with the president's stimulus package. "The House always seems to get rolled," the aide said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi "didn't really weigh in either way" during the meeting about how members should vote on the president's plan, according to the aide, "but she certainly wasn't cheerleading for it." But Pelosi made it clear Democrats were unhappy, telling reporters outside the meeting, "I think it's fair to say that there is a certain amount of unease with the proposal that was put forth by the president." She also noted that the estate tax benefits a much smaller number of families than the middle-class tax cut. The senior Democratic aide conceded that despite the threats to vote against the plan, it's also a reality that the proposal could still pass the House. "This gets done, but does not get done with a majority of Democratic votes," the aide said. Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk to House Democrats Wednesday afternoon. Asked whether Biden could convince Democrats to support the plan, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer quipped, "You'll have to ask him." Hoyer didn't directly answer whether he believed House Democrats could make significant changes to the administration's plan, saying, "I think it's under discussion," but he added, "the majority of the House is still Democratic" Share this on:</text>

<title>Senate set to pass tax package; House divided over estate tax deal - CNN.com</title>
<text>Senate set to pass tax package; House divided over estate tax deal By the CNN Wire Staff Politicians' tax cut doubletalk NEW: The final Senate vote is set for Wednesday Hoyer says House Democrats may then try to alter the estate tax provision Moderate House Democrats call for passing the bill unchanged Lower Bush-era tax rates are set to expire at the end of the year Washington CNN -- Senators made speeches into the evening Tuesday on the tax and benefits package negotiated by President Barack Obama and Republican leaders, while House Democrats argued about whether they will change the measure after expected Senate approval. The deal received strong bipartisan support in clearing a key Senate procedural hurdle Monday, with an 83-15 vote to end debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced Tuesday night that the final vote would take place Wednesday. The package includes a two-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire December 31, and also would extend unemployment benefits for 13 months, cut the payroll tax by 2 percentage points for a year, lower a restored estate tax, and continue a series of other tax breaks. The estate tax -- currently scheduled to exempt inheritances up to $1 million and tax amounts above that at a rate of 55% -- would be reduced under the tax package to a rate of 35 percent on amounts above a $5 million exemption. Republican leaders argue that a full return of the estate tax would, among other things, make it nearly impossible for many family-owned small businesses to be passed down from one generation to the next. The estate tax impact Obama makes case for tax plan Obama urges House to 'act quickly' RELATED TOPICS U.S. Senate House and Senate liberals have repeatedly argued that a lower or nonexistent estate tax would merely benefit the wealthy while doing little to aid the economy. House Democrats want to change the estate tax to levels previously approved in a separate House bill that would exempt inheritances up to $3.5 million and tax amounts above that at a 45 percent rate. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, predicted Tuesday that the House will ultimately pass the bill, but might alter the estate tax provision. However, more than two dozen moderate House Democrats submitted a letter to the House Democratic leadership Tuesday calling for the tax package to be passed unchanged so it can go directly to Obama to be signed into law. "This bipartisan compromise is by design a temporary measure and, with its passage, we must acknowledge that our work is not done," said the letter signed by 27 House Democrats as of Tuesday evening. "We must continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion -- with a sense of shared responsibility -- toward solutions that address our economic and fiscal challenges. It is time for us to put aside the partisan talking points and accomplish what the American people sent us here to do." Republicans involved in the negotiations with the White House on the package warned that any changes by the House could derail the entire proposal, causing tax rates to increase in 2011. "If the House Democratic leadership decides to make partisan changes, they will ensure that every American taxpayer will see a job-killing tax hike on January 1st," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a statement Monday. Anticipating final Senate approval of the measure, Obama has urged the House to pass it quickly, despite misgivings by some Democrats. "I recognize that folks on both sides of the political spectrum are unhappy" with parts of the deal, Obama said Monday, calling it "the nature of compromise." Overall, he said, the measure will help bolster recovery from recession and provide taxpayers with certainty about what they will owe in 2011. If the House eventually passes a bill that differs from the Senate version, the revised package would need to return to the Senate for another vote. The Senate, in turn, could send back the original bill without any changes to the estate tax provision for a second House vote. Such a scenario, analysts note, would give House liberals unhappy with the president's plan a chance to say they tried to change it. In total, the tax and benefits package is expected to add $893 billion to the federal debt over the next five years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. With the Bush tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, Obama and Democrats face a fast-approaching deadline to reach a deal. Republicans won control of the House and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate in the new Congress convening in January, which would give Democrats less leverage to negotiate after the current lame-duck session. House liberals are not the only ones objecting to the agreement. A number of conservatives -- including likely 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- are challenging the deal because it doesn't permanently extend the Bush tax cuts and would add to the deficit. CNN's Dana Bash, Tom Cohen, Alan Silverleib and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report. Share this on:</text>

<title>How to cheat the tax man in 2010 - CNN.com</title>
<text>How to cheat the tax man in 2010 By Bob Greene, CNN Contributor Thanks to a strange quirk in the law, the heirs of people who die this year don't have to pay estate taxes. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Tax law eliminates estate tax this year, but restores it in 2011 Bob Greene says some very wealthy people could save heirs millions if they die this year Greene: Will those who make it past December 31st feel that their families got cheated RELATED TOPICS Editor's note: CNN Contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose books include " Late Edition: A Love Story " and "When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams." CNN -- Want a hot tip about how to make a financial killing this year Die. That's right. It sounds like a distasteful joke, but courtesy of the United States Congress, it's a gruesome reality. Because of a hiccup in the convoluted tax laws, Americans who have done exceptionally well for themselves during their lives will be able to preserve an enormously greater percentage of their money, and thus be able to pass it on to their heirs, if they die before midnight on December 31. The federal estate tax, for this calendar year only, is zero percent; at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve it immediately goes to a potential 55 percent for people who have managed to build up a considerable nest egg for their families. The 55 percent rate will apply to everything after the first $1 million in assets, if the current law stands. Congress still has the beat-the-clock option to step in and change the rules for next year, but so far has not. The details of the back-and-forth in Congress that has led to this are enough to give you a headache, and those mice-trapped-in-a-maze legislative machinations have been exhaustively reported on and analyzed. Suffice it to say that the smart people in the world of money and investments -- the ones who always seem to know when it's time to move to municipal bonds, or to roll their cash over into some exotic derivative, or to switch to real estate -- are now saying that dying this year is a sound financial strategy. As the Wall Street Journal recently put it: "It has come to this: Congress, quite by accident, is incentivizing death." No one is kidding about the basic facts of this. The Bernie Madoff scheme may have been unspeakably cruel, and the tricks played by the big investment banks may have been infuriating, but at least no one was telling people that they'd better die quickly if they'd like to let their families hang on to their money. The Journal ran a photo gallery of six prominent men who beat the system by dying this year: former TV host Art Linkletter, actor Dennis Hopper, Taco Bell founder Glen Bell, novelist Louis Auchincloss, real estate developer Walter Shorenstein and author J.D. Salinger. The most-talked about beneficiary -- if you can call it that, which you probably shouldn't -- of this tax weirdness is George Steinbrenner, the late owner of the New York Yankees who died last month. Under the headline "Why Now Is a Great Time to Die," financial journalist Lauren Drell, who writes for AOL, calculated that by dying this year instead of next, Steinbrenner saved his relatives approximately $600 million. What do you call a system that allows such a thing to happen "Grisly" is the word that tax expert Barbara Weltman used when she spoke to Drell: "There's talk about pulling the plug on people on life support ... [It is] just horrible to think that taxes should play any role in life-and-death decisions." But the same people who knew how to play all the angles to build an enviable financial life for themselves are now coming face to face with the ultimate angle. As attorney and estate planner Jack Nuckolls told The Associated Press: "If you're super-wealthy, it's a good year to die. It really is." Last year, when the estate tax was 45 percent, people in ill health faced a different kind of challenge: If they could just hold on until the first few seconds of 2010, then they could die knowing that their money had made it into the freakish one-year holiday from estate taxes. But as sadistic as that setup was -- imagine having to fight for a few more breaths because if you made it to New Year's Day, you could do a better job of providing for your children -- at least it put a premium on living. What's scheduled to happen in a little more than four months is the opposite. Those who die are the fiscal winners. There doesn't seem much to be done about it, except engage in dark wit. Eugene Sukup, 81, of Sheffield, Iowa, who founded a grain-bin manufacturing firm with $15,000 in 1963 and who has presided over it with such skill that today it provides jobs for 450 Iowans, told the Wall Street Journal that if he were to die this year he would not have to pay a penny in estate taxes. But if he were to live until the dawning moments of next year and then pass away, his bill could be $15 million. He seems to have a sense of humor about this insanity unless he's not kidding. He said: "You don't know whether to commit suicide or just go on living and working." That's what is so Alice-through-the-looking-glass about all of this, and that is why, in its nonsensical way, the tax situation is a parable for the financial madness of our times. If you've been fortunate in your life, and have accumulated a sizeable amount of money and property to leave to your children and grandchildren, and your health is starting to fail, you can hope for one more springtime with your family, and a seat in front of the television set to watch the 2011 Super Bowl, and a chance to gaze upon the fireworks and the community parade next Fourth of July. But if you do, will you feel like a sucker Will you feel like you've wished for something foolish Will you weigh the joy of one more year against the empty feeling of having your pocket picked by the lunacy of this particular law "Happy new year," for some people, may soon enough sound like a taunt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene. Share this on:</text>

<title>AllPolitics - Issues</title>
<text>Q U I C K  T A K E AN ISSUE NEAR AND DEAR TO MOST VOTERS, tax policy figured prominently in the GOP primaries and has become a dominant issue of the fall campaign. Looking for traction, Bob Dole has focused his message as other Republicans have before him on a platform of sweeping tax cuts, while Bill Clinton is pushing targeted breaks while warning that large cuts will "balloon the deficit." Ross Perot, for his part, dismisses large tax cuts but talks seductively of dismantling the Internal Revenue Service. It's a complicated issue. First instituted in 1913, the income tax rate hit an all time high of 91 percent for upper income earners in 1962. John F. Kennedy, perhaps the first supply-sider to occupy the White House, brought the rate down to 70 percent arguing the high rate was stifling economic growth. That wasn't nearly far enough for Ronald Reagan, whose 1981 tax reform promised a 30 percent cut over three years. Five years later, a massive tax reform bill closed loopholes and brought the top rate down to 28 percent. Soon, loopholes were back, and George Bush raised the top rate back to 31 percent, followed by Bill Clinton who jacked the top rate to 39.6 percent in 1993 and gave Americans their current five-tier system. Of course, the income tax is but one of many levies used to generate federal revenues. As the tax code has become increasingly complex -- more than seven million words and counting -- politicians from the left and right are pushing a more simplified tax code. Critics say the current maze of regulations has become a vehicle for special interest abuse, with high-priced lobbyists able to win tax code favors as ordinary Americans see their rates go up. Last year, Americans spent about $500 billion getting professional help to do their taxes. Early in 1996, publisher Malcolm S. "Steve" Forbes generated enthusiasm for his 17 percent, no deductions flat tax proposal, an idea quickly adopted in various forms by other GOP primary candidates Perot says he'd consider it, too. As an idea, the flat tax dates at least to the early 1980s when two Stanford scholars published a study extolling its virtues of simplicity and efficiency. The flat tax, however, has proved an easy target for "fairness" watchdogs. Though Democrats as diverse as Leon Panetta and former California Gov. Jerry Brown have previously proposed it, most Democrats feel it's a giveaway to the wealthy who they believe ought to pay higher rates. Backed by a Treasury study of Rep. Dick Armey's flat tax plan, Democrats pilloried the flat tax as losing government revenue by more $100 billion per year. Even many Republicans are squeamish about an idea that has all Americans, regardless of income, paying the same rate. The Forbes proposal also came under heated attack for not maintaining the popular deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations. The idea not to tax investment income conjured unpalatable scenarios of unemployed millionaires paying no taxes while working stiffs picked up the tab Forbes argued that under the current system investment income was effectively taxed twice. Other radical proposals for revamping the tax code include replacing the IRS with a national retail sales tax supported by House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer and the value-added tax VAT, used in many European countries. Under the VAT, products and services are taxed at various stages of their production. Proponents of these ideas cite simplicity and fairness, while critics point to potential problems getting business to comply. About the only Republican candidate without a flat tax proposal was Bob Dole though his tax commission, headed by Jack Kemp, came awfully close to endorsing the concept. Though he has traditionally stressed reducing the deficit before cutting taxes, Dole, in July 1996, called for a 15 percent, across-the-board tax rate cut and end to the Internal Revenue Service "as we know it." Backed by respected Stanford economist John Taylor and some other heavyweight academics, Dole began pushing tax cuts as the key to faster growth. Dole and Co. argue they can cut taxes and still balance the budget by 2002, a goal both parties agreed to this year. Dole's plan, in part, relies on supply-side economic theory which holds that lower rates, by stimulating the economy and broadening the tax base, do not necessarily produce lower tax revenues and might even increase them. In response to critics who say the Reagan era tax cuts caused skyrocketing deficits, tax cutters say the real problem was Congress -- then controlled by the Democrats -- which did not control spending. With a Republican Congress, Dole says he could balance the budget and cut taxes. For Democrats, most of whom reject the tax cutting-to-growth argument, it's simply an article of faith that the 1980s tax cuts resulted in massive deficits. Echoing that sentiment, Clinton has come out "unalterably opposed" to large-scale tax cuts as a boon to the wealthy and a budget buster. The president's tax strategy relies on targeted tax breaks, which he says will stimulate the economy and provide relief to Americans who need it. Among his more recent proposals are: A targeted capital gains tax cut for middle-income families who sell their homes. A $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit for the first two years of college. Credits to businesses that hire people off welfare. Expanded tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts. A $5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents Dole, in addition to his 15 percent cut, has a laundry list of targeted tax breaks too, including: A $500 per child tax credit for families. A repeal President Clinton's 1993 Social Security tax increase on upper-income beneficiaries. A halving of the capital gains tax from the current 28 percent to a maximum of 14 percent on profits made from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets. An expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts. The elimination of the estate tax. Populist Perot has picked up on the issue of tax simplification, promising to dismantle the IRS and overhaul the nation's tax code. Not committed to any one proposal yet, the Texan says he'll consider the flat tax, the consumption tax, the national sales tax, the savings tax, the value-added tax, and the financial transactions tax.

Ross Perot, for his part, dismisses large tax cuts but talks seductively of dismantling the Internal Revenue Service.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >It's a complicated issue.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >First instituted in 1913, the income tax rate hit an all time high of 91 percent for upper income earners in 1962.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >John F.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Kennedy, perhaps the first supply-sider to occupy the White House, brought the rate down to 70 percent arguing the high rate was stifling economic growth.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >That wasn't nearly far enough for Ronald Reagan, whose 1981 tax reform promised a 30 percent cut over three years.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Five years later, a massive tax reform bill closed loopholes and brought the top rate down to 28 percent.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Soon, loopholes were back, and George Bush raised the top rate back to 31 percent, followed by Bill Clinton who jacked the top rate to 39.6 percent in 1993 and gave Americans their current five-tier system.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Of course, the income tax is but one of many levies used to generate federal revenues.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >As the tax code has become increasingly complex -- more than seven million words and counting -- politicians from the left and right are pushing a more simplified tax code.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Critics say the current maze of regulations has become a vehicle for special interest abuse, with high-priced lobbyists able to win tax code favors as ordinary Americans see their rates go up.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Last year, Americans spent about $500 billion getting professional help to do their taxes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Early in 1996, publisher Malcolm S.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >"Steve" Forbes generated enthusiasm for his 17 percent, no deductions flat tax proposal, an idea quickly adopted in various forms by other GOP primary candidates Perot says he'd consider it, too.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >As an idea, the flat tax dates at least to the early 1980s when two Stanford scholars published a study extolling its virtues of simplicity and efficiency.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The flat tax, however, has proved an easy target for "fairness" watchdogs.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Though Democrats as diverse as Leon Panetta and former California Gov.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Jerry Brown have previously proposed it, most Democrats feel it's a giveaway to the wealthy who they believe ought to pay higher rates.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Backed by a Treasury study of Rep.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Dick Armey's flat tax plan, Democrats pilloried the flat tax as losing government revenue by more $100 billion per year.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Even many Republicans are squeamish about an idea that has all Americans, regardless of income, paying the same rate.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The Forbes proposal also came under heated attack for not maintaining the popular deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >The idea not to tax investment income conjured unpalatable scenarios of unemployed millionaires paying no taxes while working stiffs picked up the tab Forbes argued that under the current system investment income was effectively taxed twice.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Other radical proposals for revamping the tax code include replacing the IRS with a national retail sales tax supported by House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer and the value-added tax VAT, used in many European countries.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Under the VAT, products and services are taxed at various stages of their production.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Proponents of these ideas cite simplicity and fairness, while critics point to potential problems getting business to comply.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >About the only Republican candidate without a flat tax proposal was Bob Dole though his tax commission, headed by Jack Kemp, came awfully close to endorsing the concept.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Though he has traditionally stressed reducing the deficit before cutting taxes, Dole, in July 1996, called for a 15 percent, across-the-board tax rate cut and end to the Internal Revenue Service "as we know it." Backed by respected Stanford economist John Taylor and some other heavyweight academics, Dole began pushing tax cuts as the key to faster growth.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Dole and Co. argue they can cut taxes and still balance the budget by 2002, a goal both parties agreed to this year.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Dole's plan, in part, relies on supply-side economic theory which holds that lower rates, by stimulating the economy and broadening the tax base, do not necessarily produce lower tax revenues and might even increase them.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >In response to critics who say the Reagan era tax cuts caused skyrocketing deficits, tax cutters say the real problem was Congress -- then controlled by the Democrats -- which did not control spending.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >With a Republican Congress, Dole says he could balance the budget and cut taxes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >For Democrats, most of whom reject the tax cutting-to-growth argument, it's simply an article of faith that the 1980s tax cuts resulted in massive deficits.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Echoing that sentiment, Clinton has come out "unalterably opposed" to large-scale tax cuts as a boon to the wealthy and a budget buster.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >The president's tax strategy relies on targeted tax breaks, which he says will stimulate the economy and provide relief to Americans who need it.</sentence>
<sentence cont=1 >Among his more recent proposals are: A targeted capital gains tax cut for middle-income families who sell their homes.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >A $1,500-a-year tuition tax credit for the first two years of college.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Credits to businesses that hire people off welfare.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >Expanded tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >A $5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents Dole, in addition to his 15 percent cut, has a laundry list of targeted tax breaks too, including: A $500 per child tax credit for families.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >A repeal President Clinton's 1993 Social Security tax increase on upper-income beneficiaries.</sentence>
<sentence cont=0 >A halving of the capital gains tax from the current 28 percent to a maximum of 14 percent on profits made from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets.</sentence>

<title>AllPolitics - Estate Taxes: Lotted Legacies - May 5, 1997</title>
<text>Tap into AllPolitics' archive of TIME articles from the days before the internet. Death And Lower Taxes The estate levy seems sure to be cut as more nonplutocrats discover it will hit their kids too By George J. Church TIME, May 5 -- Robert Hartman had not looked at his will in 17 years. But when his first grandchild was born, he decided to update it, and he made a nasty discovery. A former assistant director for the Congressional Budget Office, Hartman, now 59 and retired, says, "I kind of knew" that only the first $600,000 of an individual's estate is exempt from federal estate tax. But, he says, "like most people, I didn't really focus on it. Then I sat down to do the math [on how much of his estate might go to the IRS rather than to his two sons] and said, 'Uh-oh, that's a big tax bite.'" If Hartman was surprised, imagine the reaction of less tax-savvy people who suddenly realize that their heirs face a worry usually thought to be reserved for Rockefellers. Thanks to decades-long booms in stock and real estate values, more people are making the dismal discovery every year, and their shock is compounded when they learn how stiff the tax is. It starts at 37% on amounts in excess of $600,000 and escalates to 41% on amounts over $1 million and 55% on anything over $3 million. Enough people are mad enough, in fact, to fuel what is becoming an irresistible tax-cutting drive. Some reduction in the estate tax is nearly certain to be part of any 1997 budget-balancing deal, and it is possible that relief will be granted even if no budget compromise is reached. "I haven't seen this kind of support [for a tax cut] in the 26 years I've been in Congress," says Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. On the Democratic side, President Clinton has proposed some modest reductions, and is obviously preparing to go along with deeper ones. One indication: Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers last week accused those who propose repealing the tax of "selfishness," but then issued a public apology. That was a humiliation the proud Summers would probably endure only under presidential orders. So much fuss might seem surprising, given the numbers involved. True, it is expected that more than twice as many estates will be taxed in 2007 as were in 1995. But that would still be only 73,000, or around 3% of the total. Liberals are fond of contrasting those numbers with the 10 million children who lack health insurance. Numbers, however, do not tell the whole story. Those hurt worst by the tax have traditionally been farmers and owners of small businesses, two politically powerful blocs. The value of their estates tends to be concentrated heavily in land, buildings and machinery, with little cash left to heirs, who have to sell the business, or chunks of it, to pay the tax. Increasingly, though, the tax is hitting professionals and middle managers--lawyers, accountants, engineers, sales managers. Some own homes they bought for $20,000 or so in the 1960s that are worth easily 10 times as much today. Many have socked away money in mutual funds or burgeoning 401k plans, reinvested dividends and capital-gains distributions, and piled up huge profits--so far mostly on paper. A final argument is that the tax causes losses in output and jobs that far outweigh the $19 billion it will pump into the Treasury this year. Part of the damage results from the sale and breakup of thriving farms and businesses. The environment suffers too, in the opinion of the Environmental Defense Fund. It says lowering the estate tax "may be the most important reform of all" to keep farmland out of the hands of housing developers. Even bigger losses are thought to result because money is diverted from productive investment and paid to lawyers and accountants who hunt for ways to escape or minimize the tax. The heirs to enormous fortunes, of course, can do this better than nonplutocrats. And so the tax has never broken up concentrations of wealth the way the legislators who enacted it in 1916 hoped it would. What to do At one extreme, a Republican bill would repeal the tax entirely. At the other, the White House would merely let heirs to family-owned farms and businesses stretch out payments over 14 years, as now, but defer more tax and pay lower interest on it. The most likely basis for compromise is a G.O.P. bill that has picked up some Democratic support. It would raise the general exemption from $600,000 to $1 million; farms and businesses would be taxed only on half of any amount over $1.5 million. There is already much talk of a final compromise making the general exemption $750,000, but that depends heavily on how much money may be allotted to tax relief in an overall budget deal. Some easing seems all but certain, however. Death and taxes are proverbially inevitable, but they need not so often be synonymous. --Reported by John F.

<title>CNN Electoral Map: Obama would win if election held today - CNN.com</title>
<text>Obama in position to take Virginia from GOP In a CNN poll of polls released Wednesday evening, Obama is favored to win by 50 percent; McCain by 43 percent and 8 percent of voters are undecided. CNN also switched North Dakota from a safe McCain state to one leaning toward McCain, and New Jersey from leaning toward Obama to safe Obama. Neither of those moves affected the overall electoral vote count in the CNN estimate. Watch more on the fight for battleground states » "This is not good news for John McCain. He's heading in the wrong direction at a time when he needs to be gaining electoral votes, not losing them. But he's been left for dead before and has come roaring back. This election is not over yet," said CNN political editor Mark Preston. The CNN Electoral Map is based on analysis from the CNN Political Unit and takes into account a number of factors, including polling, state voting trends, ad spending patterns, candidate visits and guidance from the campaigns, parties and political strategists. The list will be updated regularly as the campaign develops over time. Obama's advance in traditionally red states has the GOP on the defense. The McCain- Palin ticket has spent much of the week stumping in states where Obama seems poised for an unexpectedly strong showing. A new CNN/Time Magazine/Opinion Research Corporation survey in Virginia released Wednesday indicates that Obama holds a 10-point lead over McCain -- 53 percent to 43 percent among likely voters. Watch how Virginia is leaning toward Obama in latest poll » "Obama is winning men and women in Virginia, and is doing well across the state east of the Blue Ridge Mountains," CNN polling director Keating Holland said. It's a similar story in Colorado, a state that hasn't voted for a Democrat in the race for the White House in 16 years. The new poll indicates the Illinois senator holds a four-point edge over McCain, 51 percent to 47 percent. Watch more on if Colorado could go blue » And in Georgia, a state that Bush won by 17 points over Kerry four years ago and that hasn't voted for the Democrats in a presidential contest in 16 years, the poll suggests only a six-point lead for McCain, 51 percent to 45 percent. The poll also indicates Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain in Florida, 51 percent to 46 percent. Twenty-seven electoral votes are up for grabs in Florida. Bush took the state by five points in the last election. In Missouri, which Bush won in the past two presidential contests, the new poll suggests it's basically a dead heat, with McCain holding a one-point advantage over Obama, 49 percent to 48 percent. "Of course, it's important to remember that the CNN Electoral Map is a snapshot in time," Silverleib said. "We are not predicting an Obama win on Election Day. We still have 20 days to go, and that's an eternity in politics."</text>

<title>Why some Americans won't vote - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why some Americans won't vote By Josh Levs, CNN updated 1:27 AM EST, Wed November 7, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Many voters say it's a civic duty to cast their ballot One voter says not voting would be spitting on troops who sacrificed A non-voter rails against the two-party stem Another non-voter says the electoral system means there's "no sense" in voting in his state CNN -- Despite all the talk about the presidential election, the fact remains: Millions of Americans won't vote. U.S. turnout in the 2008 presidential election was 90% of registered voters, but only 71% of the U.S. adult population was registered to vote . For Election Day 2012, we asked people around the country to weigh in on what's inspiring them to vote -- and we asked non-voters why they're sitting this one out. "I am a parent, teacher and citizen. I have a responsibility to help shape the future of my country," Bhakti Mary Hudson wrote in our Facebook discussion . "I always vote. It's my right. I need to have my voice heard!" wrote Raquel Watson. Paul Ryan votes in Wisconsin hometown Biden hints he may be on future ballots Obama jokes around while voting Romney votes, 'feels good' about Ohio "Since it's my first time being able to vote in a presidential election, I am voting," wrote Karlos Dominic Curtis-Chaverst, a broadcast journalism student at The University of Alabama. "I have waited on this moment for about 10 years now!" "I am a woman and I honor those that died and fought for my right -- a right that is an American freedom," said Heather Tilton Benoit. But those who aren't voting offered some passionate explanations. "I will never participate in a two-party system that does not allow for anyone but a Democrat or Republican," wrote Nathan Rennicker, accusing big corporations of "throwing money to bury" third-party candidates "under BS." And Joe Vellano said he's not voting because there's "no sense" in doing so in New York. Others around the country have expressed similar sentiments -- that because of the electoral system, they feel their votes don't have adequate worth in states that don't have close races. "I wish I lived in a state where my vote mattered," wrote Matthew Bush. "Down with the electoral college!" The vast majority of people who joined the discussion said they will vote and feel it's a responsibility. Luke Rhinewalt offered this: "I am voting because of the tens of thousands of soldiers, marines, naval personnel, and airmen and officers who have suffered, led, sacrificed, bled, and died for this great nation. To not vote would be to spit on their service, sacrifice, limbs, and lives." "Plus," he said, offering a dash of humor, "I like to rant, rave, and talk politics too much to have to admit I did not vote in an election."

<title>Why Election Day won't be postponed - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why Election Day won't be postponed By Martina Stewart, CNN Political Producer updated 9:12 AM EDT, Thu November 1, 2012 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Presidential Election Day is set by Congress under its authority in the Constitution Election Day can only be changed if a new federal law is passed But a state will probably be allowed to postpone voting only in disaster-affected areas Statewide postponement of the presidential vote is an open legal question Washington CNN -- With Superstorm Sandy leaving communities under water, stranding millions without power and consuming public resources in several states, could next Tuesday's vote for president be moved to a later date Sandy leaves election officials scrambling No, it can't. Without passage of a new federal law, voting for president is required to take place on Tuesday, November 6, as planned. But, partial postponements of voting in some affected areas are possible, consistent with the laws governing the election of the president and vice president. Here's why: Booker: Newark will be able to vote Christie: I'm not going to play politics Romney's new focus: Storm relief Presidential race in 'dead heat' When people go to the polls on Election Day, they aren't voting directly for their choice for president or vice president. Instead, they are voting to select representatives -- or "electors" -- to the Electoral College, the body that actually determines who will be president and vice president. Candidates, voters forced to navigate Sandy The Constitution gives Congress the authority to determine "time" of choosing those electors. In 1845, Congress passed a law that set the Tuesday immediately following the first Monday in November of every election year as Election Day across the country. The same law also gives states some leeway in picking electors to the Electoral College. But to exercise that leeway, a state must have "held an election for the purpose of choosing electors," and "failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law." When that happens, the law says "the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such manner as the legislature of such state may direct." Sandy's impact: State by state Based on this, the Congressional Research Service, a federal agency that provides legislative research support to Congress, concluded in a 2004 report that a state could probably hold presidential voting on Election Day in places unaffected by a natural disaster but postpone it until a later date in affected areas without violating federal law so long as the state met other legal requirements relating to electing the president and vice president. But the law passed by Congress setting Election Day only allows a state to pick its electors on a later date if it has already held an election on Election Day and "failed to make a choice" on that day. So a complete statewide postponement would arguably violate the 1845 law, the 2004 report suggested. But the report also pointed out that the Supreme Court has emphasized the role states play in selecting the presidential electors, so a state might be allowed to postpone an entire statewide vote for president in emergency circumstances like a hurricane or other natural disaster.

<title>Children could get death penalty as Maldives brings back executions - CNN.com</title>
<text>Children could get death penalty as Maldives brings back executions By Euan McKirdy, CNN updated 9:41 AM EDT, Thu May 1, 2014 The reinstated death penalty in the Maldives would most likely see lethal injections used as the method of execution. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Maldives reinstates the death penalty after 61 years Some provisions of the new law mean minors could potentially be executed U.N and EU have expressed their opposition to the decision CNN -- The Maldives overturned a six-decade-old moratorium on capital punishment with the adoption of a new regulation this week that allows for the death penalty to be used to punish certain crimes. The Maldivian government enacted the regulation, which makes provision for execution by lethal injection, for the crimes of premeditated murder or deliberate manslaughter. While the age of criminal responsibility is 10 in the Maldives, some crimes under the country's Sharia laws -- known as Hadd offenses -- have an age of responsibility of 7. This means that juveniles could potentially face execution in the archipelago. Execution facilities at the Maldives' Maafushi Prison were being built to carry out sentences. Since reenacted, 20 people have been sentenced to death, although one of these sentences was overturned by the High Court, a report in the country's Haveeru newspaper said. Local Maldives media reported that Minister of Home Affairs Umar Naseer defended the decision to reinstate the penalty, saying that the Maldives was suffering from overcrowded prisons and a "lively criminal environment." He was also quoted as saying that the Maldives was "a hundred percent Islamic country and there are certain values that we all believe in." The U.N. and EU have expressed their concerns about the move, which could potentially see minors killed by the state. "According to the new regulation, minors convicted of intentional murder shall be executed once they turn 18. Similar provisions in the recently ratified Penal Code, allowing for the application of the death penalty for crimes committed when below the age of 18, are also deeply regrettable," Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement . "We urge the Government to retain its moratorium on the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, particularly in cases that involve juvenile offenders and to work towards abolishing the practice altogether." EU High Representative Catherine Ashton was also "deeply concerned" about the adoption of the regulations and urged the Maldives to retain the moratorium on the death penalty. "The High Representative holds a strong and principled position against the death penalty," a statement issued by her office said. "The death penalty is cruel and inhumane, and has not been shown in any way to act as a deterrent to crime."</text>

<title>Connecticut becomes 17th state to abolish death penalty - CNN.com</title>
<text>Connecticut becomes 17th state to abolish death penalty By David Ariosto, CNN updated 5:41 PM EDT, Wed April 25, 2012 Death penalty protesters hold a candlelight vigil after the 2005 execution of serial killer Michael Ross in Enfield, Connecticut. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a bill into law that abolishes the death penalty In last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Illinois have repealed death penalty California voters will decide the issue in November CNN -- Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed a bill into law Wednesday that abolishes the death penalty, making his state the 17th in the nation to abandon capital punishment and the fifth in five years to usher in a repeal. The law is effective immediately, though prospective in nature, meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death. It replaces the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of release as the state's highest form of punishment. "Although it is an historic moment -- Connecticut joins 16 other states and the rest of the industrialized world by taking this action -- it is a moment for sober reflection, not celebration," Malloy said in a statement. He added that the "unworkability" of Connecticut's death penalty law was a contributing factor in his decision. Death penalty by state "In the last 52 years, only two people have been put to death in Connecticut -- and both of them volunteered for it," Malloy said. "Instead, the people of this state pay for appeal after appeal, and then watch time and again as defendants are marched in front of the cameras, giving them a platform of public attention they don't deserve." This month, lawmakers in the state's House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 86 to 63. The state Senate had approved it a week before. State lawmakers first tried to pass a similar bill in 2009 but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. Capital punishment has existed in the Nutmeg State since its colonial days. But it was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972, when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 decision by the high court upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals. The state now has 11 people on death row. Advocates of a repeal say that Connecticut's past law kept inmates -- who were often engaged in multiple appeals -- on death row for extended periods of time, costing taxpayers far more than if the convicts were serving a life sentence in the general prison population. They also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods, including forensic testing. Opponents of the repeal had said that capital punishment is a criminal deterrent that offers justice for victims and their families. In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November.</text>

<title>Obama's midterm malaise - CNN.com</title>
<text>READ: Gwyneth Paltrow to Obama: 'You're so handsome that I can't speak." The gloomy mood is understandable. Former top Cabinet secretaries, and even Jimmy Carter, are hammering his policies. Key Democratic candidates are avoiding him, and in at least one case, unwilling to say if she voted for him. Next month's elections loom at a moment of great hand-wringing for the president's party. Understanding full well Obama's unpopularity is a drag on some Democrats in tight congressional races, White House officials are signaling to party leaders and campaign managers alike there will be no consequences should they run away from the president in order to win. Obama has yet to acknowledge his own weak standing with the public at any of his political events. Instead, the president appears to blame what he describes as obstructionist Republicans and a polarized, vapid news media. "We live in such a cynical time, partly because of how the media is now structured," Obama said at Paltrow's home. "We only listen to folks who feed our biases and our inclinations. And bad news tends to attract the most attention," he added. Obama: This is suicide for Republicans Is life lonely in the Oval Office Michelle campaigning on 22nd anniversary At an earlier event in the day, Obama used stark language to label House Republican refusals to pass immigration reform "suicide." The president seemed to retool at least part of his midterm pitch, after declaring his policies are "on the ballot" in November, a line that his former strategist David Axelrod called a mistake. In Hollywood, there was a re-write to that declaration. "My name is not on the ballot," Obama said in Los Angeles. "But our values and our ideals... are at stake," he added, avoiding any reference to his "policies." READ: Have Democrats already lost the Senate Democratic candidates in critical races across the country are scrambling to distance themselves from both Obama and his policies, especially in the south where the president remains deeply unpopular. In Kentucky, Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to answer whether she had ever voted for Obama during an appearance before the Louisville Courier-Journal editorial board Thursday. "You know, this election isn't about the president," Grimes said. "I was actually, in '08, a delegate for Hillary Clinton," she added. As he starts his own midterm push, the president is sticking to friendlier turf. In California, he made an unannounced stop at the campaign office of Democratic congressional candidate Ted Lieu, a state senator running for the seat vacated by outgoing Rep. Henry Waxman D California. "California is right at the heart of the battle for control of the House," Obama said to volunteers at Lieu's call center. "Because of just the day-to-day work you're doing, making phone calls, making sure our voters turn out, answering people's questions about what the issues are, it makes a difference -- that's how I was able to get elected." READ: House Dems worry about cash challenge White House officials reject the notion that the president's mood is grim. Obama's message at upcoming public campaign events will likely differ in tone and substance from remarks he makes at fundraisers, another official added. Obama will campaign with Connecticut governor Dan Malloy on October 15, White House officials announced Thursday. Obama's advisers argue the president still has the ability to excite base Democratic party supporters who were instrumental to his two successful runs for the White House. Steering clear of Obama, they argue, is also a gamble. "We're not bringing him in to suppress voter turnout, if that's what you're asking," Malloy quipped to the Connecticut Post. As soon as the president steps onto the stage in Connecticut, the president's rhetoric will be placed under a microscope. "Not a great way to go out of office, angry and blaming the system," former presidential adviser and CNN political analyst David Gergen said. "My sense of it is he's on an emotional roller coaster," Gergen added. Once the midterms are over, Gergen suggested a reshuffling of top White House staff to buoy the president's prospects for his final years in office. "If he shook it up a little bit, that would help," Gergen said.</text>

<title>Obama's coffee cup salute draws criticism - CNN.com</title>
<text>Obama's coffee cup salute draws criticism By Ashley Killough and Eric Weisbrod, CNN updated 2:20 PM EDT, Wed September 24, 2014 President Barack Obama's less-than-formal salute, shown here on Instagram. CNN -- With a coffee cup in hand, President Barack Obama offered a less-than-formal salute Tuesday to a Marine standing guard as he exited the presidential helicopter, Marine One. The White House Instagram account posted video of the brief scene, highlighting the President's arrival in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. But some critics quickly pounced on the President's coffee cup salute. "Wait - did President Obama just salute the Marines with a LATTE in his hand!" the National Republican Congressional Committee tweeted . It's become tradition for presidents to salute the military officers he encounters when boarding the official helicopter, a tradition that is widely understood as begun by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. A U.S. Navy manual on customs and courtesies, cited by the Daily Caller, says saluting in general is "the most important of all military courtesies." "The salute formally recognizes the officer as a military superior, and returning the salute expresses the officer's thanks for the junior's support," the manual reads. It recommends not saluting when one is "carrying articles with both hands or being otherwise so occupied as to make saluting impractical." But Obama has previously passed by a Marine without saluting -- and that got noticed as well . And former President George W. Bush did an awkward salute with his dog back in 2001. So what do you think Was Obama's coffee cup salute a sign of disrespect, or a non-story Here's what some people are saying on Twitter. .</text>

<title>Affirmative action ban heads for ballot in 5 states - CNN.com</title>
<text>Affirmative action ban heads for ballot in 5 states Story Highlights Initiative pushed in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma It would ban affirmative action in government-funded projects, public schools Initiative has already passed in California, Michigan and Washington From Lindy Royce CNN Washington Bureau CNN -- Come election time in November, voters in five states might have a decision to make as big as whom to elect president. Ballot initiatives have been proposed in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma that would give voters the chance to decide whether they want to do away with affirmative action in government-funded projects and public schools. Ward Connerly, who heads the American Civil Rights Coalition -- a nonprofit organization working to end racial and gender preferences -- and the main backer of the ballot initiatives, says the 37 word initiative would read: "The state shall not discriminate against or grant preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education or public contracting." "It would forbid any state or local agency or special district from engaging in preferential treatment," Connerly said. Watch what Connerly says about the initiative » Connerly, who is of African-American and American Indian descent, said affirmative action causes resentment. He criticized cases in which a Caucasian student might be denied a college slot in favor of a black student with a lower grade-point average. "It's foolish not to think that the kid who is turned away is not going to ... resent that," Connerly said. Connerly, who grew up in Leesville, Louisiana, said he experienced oppression because of his skin color during his youth. Don't Miss Election Center 2008 "If it was wrong when I was born in '39 ... it's wrong now," he said. "If it was wrong to do it against a brown-skinned man, it's wrong to do it against a white man." Shanta Driver, National Director of United for Equality and Affirmative Action Legal Defense Fund -- an organization dedicated to integrating minority students in educational institutions -- said the ballot initiative is a mistake. "It places us in the position of denying ... equal opportunity to blacks and Latinos," she said. Driver and other affirmative action supporters believe this movement would erase the progress made since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. "It's obviously a huge step backwards," she said. The ballot initiative, dubbed the Civil Rights Initiative, has already passed in California, Michigan and Washington. Some 140,000 signed petitions have been submitted in Oklahoma. Backers in the remaining four states have until late March to early July to collect enough signatures for the initiative to be on the November ballot. If successful, the ballot measures would cut off tax dollars for programs offering preferential treatment based on gender or race. The issue may have some support in the Supreme Court. In June, justices threw out public school choice plans that relied on race. That leaves many states uncertain about whether their affirmative action policies will stand up in court and against political scrutiny in this election year. E-mail to a friend</text>

<title>Supreme Court countdown: Big rulings coming - CNN.com</title>
<text>Supreme Court countdown: Big rulings coming By Joe Johns. Bill Mears and Josh Levs, CNN updated 7:55 AM EDT, Mon June 17, 2013 STORY HIGHLIGHTS The Supreme Court will rule on several critical cases Decisions on affirmative action, voting rights and same-sex marriage are due They could come as early as Monday or as late as the end of the month CNN -- Affirmative action. Voting rights. Same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court is about to rule on some of the most contentious issues in American society -- issues that have divided Americans for years. "These are critical decisions," said Ron Brownstein, a CNN political analyst. They affect "the future of our social relations, our workplace, our educational opportunity." The rulings could come as early as Monday. At the latest, they're expected by the end of the month. The big cases include: Affirmative action The case: Student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas, saying she was rejected partly because she is white. The school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors. See selected quotes from the arguments here The Defense of Marriage Act The case: The key plaintiff, Edith Windsor, sued the federal government after the death of her longtime female partner, saying she faced an estate bill much larger than those heterosexual married partners have to pay. Windsor married Thea Clara Spyer in 2007 in Toronto. By the time Spyer died in 2009, New York, where they lived, recognized that marriage. Under DOMA, the federal government does not. California's Proposition 8 The case: California, through Proposition 8 on a statewide ballot, banned same-sex marriage. A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that unconstitutional. Now, the Supreme Court's nine justices could fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage. The Voting Rights Act The case: The 1965 law gives federal authorities open-ended oversight of states and localities that have a history of voter discrimination. After the provision was reauthorized by Congress in 2006 for another 25 years, counties in Alabama and North Carolina filed suit , saying the monitoring was burdensome and unwarranted.</text>

<title>Controversy erupts over Campus Republicans bake sale plans - CNN.com</title>
<text>Controversy erupts over Campus Republicans bake sale plans By the CNN Wire Staff updated 7:52 AM EDT, Sun September 25, 2011 STORY HIGHLIGHTS UC Berkeley Campus Republicans plan to charge for baked goods according to race Lewis: Sale makes a statement about pending California legislation Wise: Sale is a "sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color" CNN -- Campus Republicans at the University of California Berkeley have cooked up a storm of controversy with their plans for a bake sale. But it's not your everyday collegiate fundraiser they've got in mind. They've developed a sliding scale where the price of the cookie or brownie depends on your gender and the color of your skin. During the sale, scheduled for Tuesday, baked goods will be sold to white men for $2.00, Asian men for $1.50, Latino men for $1.00, black men for $0.75 and Native American men for $0.25. All women will get $0.25 off those prices. "The pricing structure is there to bring attention, to cause people to get a little upset," Campus Republican President Shawn Lewis, who planned the event, told CNN-affiliate KGO. "But it's really there to cause people to think more critically about what this kind of policy would do in university admissions." Lewis says it's a way to make a statement about pending legislation that would let the California universities consider race or national origin during the admission process. But the young Republicans have been on the receiving end of a fierce backlash. Reaction has been so negative they've been forced to cancel their customary lunchtime tabling duties, according to KGO. Lewis told CNN's Don Lemon that they expected a certain amount of opposition but not the level of outrage they experienced. "We didn't expect the volume, the amount of response that we got," Lewis said. "In the first few hours, hundreds of posts on our Facebook page. And the tone of some of the responses -- we expected people to be upset. We didn't expect personal threats to be made. They were implicit and explicit threats made to the organizers of the event, from burning down the table to throwing our baked goods at us and other kinds of physical threats." Tim Wise, author of the book "White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son," calls the bake sale a "sarcastic and rather smarmy slap at people of color." "There are a lot of ways to make a point about your disagreement with affirmative action," Wise told Lemon Saturday night. "I get the joke," he continued. "How very original. It's been done for 15 years. The point that I think needs to be made ... is that by the time anyone steps on a college campus ... there has already been 12- to 13-years of institutionalized affirmative action for white folks, that is to say, racially embedded inequality, which has benefited those of us who are white. And it's only at the point of college admissions that these folks seem to get concerned with color consciousness." Lewis insists, however, that Campus Republicans will go ahead with their bake sale and are committed to their controversial pricing structure.</text>

<title>Emma Watson latest to use star power to help women - CNN.com</title>
<text>Emma Watson latest celeb to use star power to help women By Lisa Respers France, CNN updated 1:36 PM EDT, Mon September 22, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Emma Watson speaks as part of her role as a U.N. goodwill ambassador Other celebs have used their star power to highlight gender issues The actress said feminism is not "man-hating" CNN -- Actress Emma Watson not only stirred the Internet with her recent moving speech before the United Nations, but she also joined a cadre of celebrities who have used their star power to bring attention to gender issues. Watson, best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the "Harry Potter" films, spoke Saturday as part of the launch of a new HeForShe campaign , which is aimed at getting men involved in stopping violence against women. HeForShe is a U.N. initiative for gender equality. The actress was appointed as a goodwill ambassador for U.N. Women six months ago and advocated for everyone to be involved in the movement. "How can we affect change in the world when only half of it is invited or feel welcome to participate in the conversation" Watson said. "Men -- I would like to take this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too." Watson is just one of several celebrities who have spoken out in an effort to protect women. Actress Charlize Theron has been a U.N. ambassador of peace and recorded public service announcements for the Stop Rape Now program as part of the U.N. Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict. Through her association with the beauty company Avon where she has been an honorary chair of the Avon Foundation, Reese Witherspoon has taken on the issue of domestic violence. In 2009 Witherspoon visited the House of Commons in the United Kingdom in support of the Four Ways to Speak Out program . "You're not alone, and if you reach out, there's someone next door to you in your life who is ready to give you support and care and love, and it's important to know that," the actress said at the time. And female celebrities are not the only stars who have taken up the cause. In 2010, country singer Tim McGraw was awarded a True Ally Award at the 2010 Men Stopping Violence annual awards for his work to reduce domestic violence, which has included efforts with his wife, singer Faith Hill, to raise funds for battered women's shelters. "I am a product of domestic violence," McGraw reportedly said then. "It is a learned behavior. I learned a lot. I learned how not to treat my wife, how not to treat my family. My wife, Faith Hill, is my inspiration and my partner in all I do." In her U.N. speech Saturday, Watson said she hopes to recruit everyone in the battle to assist women. The British actress said she wanted to end the belief that feminism is equivalent to "man-hating." "We want to try to galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for change, and we don't just want to talk about it," she said. "We want to try and make sure that it's tangible."</text>

<title>Kerry: New York climate summit to set agenda - CNN.com</title>
<text>Kerry: New York climate summit to set agenda By Michael Pearson, CNN updated 2:32 PM EDT, Mon September 22, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Climate talks can set agenda for talks later this year and in 2015, Kerry says NEW: He urges political and business leaders to push for change The United Nations holds a climate summit Tuesday CNN -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry opened a week of climate change talks in New York on Monday, saying he's hopeful the discussions will set the tone for upcoming negotiations on an international agreement. "It's about time that world leaders come to the United Nations to recognize this threat in the way that it requires and demands," Kerry said in his keynote address to business and government leaders attending Climate Week NYC, a private climate-change event that coincides with the U.N. summit scheduled for Tuesday. "And it gives me hope that this global summit may actually produce the leadership that is necessary to try to come together and move the needle, to take advantage of the small window of time -- and I mean that -- the small window of time that we have left in order to be able to prevent the worst impacts of climate change from already happening." He urged participants to use their influence to steer world leaders toward committing to greater action on climate change in time for discussions on an international climate change agreement to be held in Lima, Peru, in December and in Paris in 2015. His speech reflected efforts to recruit businesses to the climate-change reduction bandwagon, focusing as much on the economic opportunities of transitioning to a low-carbon economy as on the perils of failing to do so. Climate activists take on Wall Street "It's the mother of all markets," he said of the energy sector. "The solution to climate change is a win, win, win, win if people would stop and look at it," he said. His remarks came a day before the United Nations holds a summit of world leaders to discuss the same issue. Some 125 countries will attend the session, according to the Climate Group, which is organizing Climate Week NYC. On Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters marched in New York, demanding results on climate change policies. One marcher's sign read "cut your emissions or you'll sleep with the fishes." Part of complete coverage on Climate change 11 ways climate change affects the world updated 5:35 PM EDT, Wed September 24, 2014 The consequences of climate change go far beyond warming temperatures. Here's a look at 10 other key effects of climate change.

<title>AllPolitics - Term Limits Fail - Feb. 12, 1997</title>
<text>articles about Term Limits Die In The House WASHINGTON AllPolitics, Feb. 12 -- The House took up the issue of term limits today, but not even the idea's supporters were surprised when members voted against imposing a cap on how long they may serve in Congress. The vote was 217-211, 69 votes short of the two-thirds needed to limit lawmakers' tenure. Defeated two years ago, a constitutional amendment for term limits became the first House business of the new Congress and the arguments sounded familiar on the House floor. It gained even fewer votes this time around. "It is vital that if Congress is going to serve the American people well its members not become stale and immune to the will of the people," Rep. Mark Foley R-Fla. said before the vote. But Rep. Barney Frank D-Mass. suggested it would mean fewer choices. "This essentially seeks to alter democracy to reduce the choices of the voters," Frank said. Term limits advocates knew their chances were bleak. "This isn't going to pass this year," said Paul Jacob, executive director of U.S. Term Limits. "It may not pass in the next Congress." The House Judiciary Committee, over the objections of its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde R-Ill., a passionate term limits opponent, approved holding members of the House and Senate to 12 years, but there was no recommendation for full House passage. Still, Speaker Newt Gingrich got to keep a promise made two years ago. "So this issue's not dead," Gingrich said then. "It's coming back." In fact, U.S. Term Limits charges Gingrich and others are playing games with the issue, once a top item in the GOP Contract With America . Said Jacob: "Newt Gingrich has refused to open up a dialogue with term limits activists. I think that demonstrates the lack of commitment on the part of the speaker and on many long-term incumbents in Congress." But Jacob said there will be increasing pressure on Congress from the states. Twenty of them -- California is the largest -- have adopted limits for their own state lawmakers. And in nine states -- Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Arkansas, Missouri and Maine -- members of Congress who vote against term limits are identified on the ballot, with this provision: "Disregarded or violated voter instruction on term limits." About a dozen other states, including California, may adopt the warning label next year. Click here for technical help or to send us feedback . Copyright © 1997 AllPolitics All Rights Reserved.

<title>AllPolitics - Reform Party</title>
<text>  Help Called by many the "Perot Party," the Reform Party was created in 1995 under pressure from Ross Perot's grassroots "citizen's watchdog group," United We Stand. This new party centered around their star candidate, Ross Perot, and has focused almost entirely on trying to shape presidential politics. With what many critics call a limited agenda, the Reform Party considers campaign finance reform, term limits, a balanced budget, and lobbyist control its primary concerns. The Reform platform concentrates on economic issues, due mainly to Perot's influence. The party frames its major issues in a "Principles of Reform" -- a nine-point pledge on governmental and economic reforms that all candidates must follow. Buoyed by polls that showed nearly two out of three voters dissatisfied with the current political parties, the Reform Party aims to provide an alternative for those Americans unhappy with their political choices. The Reform Party has been criticized for its narrow focus on the presidential election. The party's strategy is to concentrate all of its money and resources on one large goal, rather than fielding candidates for other offices. In its first year the party gathered for a two-part convention, the first session in Long Beach, Calif., and the second one in Valley Forge, Pa. In between, Reform Party members voted via phone, mail, or the Internet for their presidential choice, selecting Perot over rival Dick Lamm, the former Colorado governor. In its short existence, the Reform Party has demonstrated significant success. In their first election, the race for the presidency in 1996, Perot appeared on the ballot in all 50 states and received 980,000 votes, finishing third after Clinton and Dole. Reform Party</text>

<title>News anchor on Biden interview: 'I'm a journalist' - CNN.com</title>
<text>VIDEO CNN -- A Florida TV anchor became an Internet sensation this week when she pressed Democratic vice presidential candidate Sen. Joe Biden about whether Sen. Barack Obama's policies were Marxist. WFTV-TV anchor Barbara West tells Larry King she was doing her job as a reporter when she interviewed Sen. Joe Biden. Critics said WFTV-TV anchor Barbara West of Orlando had an agenda and was asking biased questions. Biden responded, "Is this a joke" CNN's Larry King on Monday talked with West about the interview on "Larry King Live." Larry King: Your recent grilling of Joe Biden has stirred up a lot of controversy. Let's take a look at part of it, and we'll get your comments. Watch. [Video clip begins] Barbara West: You may recognize this famous quote. "From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs." That's from Karl Marx. How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he's intending to spread the wealth around Sen. Joe Biden: Are you joking Is this a joke West: No. Biden: Or is that a real question West: That's a question. Larry King Live John McCain! Fighting an uphill battle for the presidency. Hear what he has to say following Barack Obama's paid address on Larry King Live Wednesday, 9pm ET see full schedule » Biden: He is not spreading the wealth around. He's talking about giving the middle class an opportunity to get back the tax breaks they used to have. I know this has been a pretty mean campaign. I was on a television station the other day and doing a satellite feed to a major network in Florida. And the anchor quotes Karl Marx and says in a sense, "Isn't Barack Obama Karl Marx" You know I mean folks, this stuff you're hearing, this stuff you're hearing in this campaign, some of it's pretty ugly. [Video clip ends] King: All right, Barbara, what were you getting to, since generally the redistribution of the wealth is a graduated income tax West: Well, Larry, no, I don't believe that it is just a graduated income tax. I think a lot of people who are talking to me out on the street are saying they are very, very concerned that this idea of redistributing the wealth means taking it out of somebody's pocket who is a wage earner and putting it in somebody's pocket who refuses to work. And they're asking about. That's what they don't want. That is what they want to know, what does this really mean My job as a journalist is to ask those questions and get those answers, and I don't believe I got answers at all. King: Was the implication in the question that Barack Obama is a Marxist West: I was asking him to tell us about how Barack Obama's redistribution of wealth was different from that quote by Karl Marx , that's all I wanted to know. ... I'm not here to debate the issues. I am not a political pundit. ... I'm a journalist. Watch as West defends her questions » And I -- my job is to ask tough, probing questions of the candidates. I had a very short time to be able to do that, only about four minutes. There were issues that I wanted to cover, including the issues about ACORN and the abuses that they've done with voter registration, particularly here in Florida, and Florida is such a key state. And also this issue of the redistribution of wealth, as well as Sen. Biden 's comments about "You mark my words, in six months, Barack Obama will be tested." King: I got you. West: But it was his caveat afterward that was the issue that I was questioning, and that is it may not be readily apparent as to what, as to whether or not the actions or whatever he does are in fact the appropriate ones. And so America, stand with him and trust him. King: I got you.</text>

<title>Zimbabwe may let whites farm again - CNN.com</title>
<text>Zimbabwe may let whites farm again Adjust font size: EAST LONDON, South Africa Reuters -- Zimbabwe, facing food shortages blamed partly on its large-scale seizures of white-owned farms, is considering allowing some interested whites to return to farming, a minister said. President Robert Mugabe's government has received more than 200 applications from whites to take up farming again, land minister Flora Buka said on Saturday during an agriculture conference in South Africa. "As regards white commercial farmers, there are some who have indicated that they would want to continue farming," Buka told Reuters. "Their applications are being considered. If they are willing to stay, that is also going to be considered. Also, the amount of land they have is also going to be considered." Asked if the government was still confiscating land from whites to redistribute to blacks, Buka said: "Yes, we are still resettling our people on the land that is state land." Many of Zimbabwe's white farmers have gone overseas or to other African countries after often violent land grabs backed by Mugabe, who initiated the redistribution program six years ago. Industry analysts say only about 600 of Zimbabwe's 4,500 white farmers have kept their land. Zimbabwe was once the breadbasket of the region and a net exporter of maize and other essential cereals to its neighbors. But food agencies say the departure of experienced white commercial farmers has cut into agricultural output and exposed Zimbabweans to persistent food shortages. Meanwhile, a severe economic crisis has led to a shortage of foreign currency and surging inflation of more than 1,000 percent annually. The U.N. World Food Program said last week 1.4 million Zimbabweans will need food aid in the next six months despite improved agricultural output last season. Mugabe's government has forecast production of 1.8 million tonnes of the staple maize, but food agencies, while acknowledging output has improved, predict a lower crop. The WFP said 10 percent of the country's estimated 12 million people would need aid before next April. Mugabe's government has defended its land program as necessary to reverse injustices of British colonial rule. As in other African countries, many blacks in Zimbabwe were forcibly removed from their land under colonialism, leaving white minorities holding most of the arable land. Copyright 2006 Reuters .

<title>Let's kill the progressive tax rate system - CNN.com</title>
<text>Let's kill the progressive tax rate system By Dorothy Brown, Special to CNN updated 7:43 AM EDT, Tue April 17, 2012 Income tax forms for 2011 are due on Tuesday. Professor Dorothy Brown argues it's time for meaningful reform. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Dorothy Brown: We live with the myth that we have a progressive tax system In fact, she says, people like Mitt Romney, Barack Obama pay at lower rates than secretaries She says the low flat rate on dividends and capital gains protects the wealthy Brown: Getting rid of the progressive tax brackets is a step toward a fairer system Editor's note: Dorothy Brown is a professor of law at Emory University. She has published numerous articles about the race and class implications of federal tax policy. Atlanta CNN -- Last week we learned that Barack and Michelle Obama's effective tax rate for 2011 was 20.5%. They had adjusted gross income of $789,674. We also learned that their tax rate was slightly lower than President Obama's secretary, who had about $95,000 of income. Ours is supposed to be a progressive rate system, which means as income gets higher, so do tax rates. In a true progressive rate system, Obama would never pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. We also know that Mitt and Ann Romney have a projected effective tax rate of 15% for 2011. They have requested an extension so we don't have their actual returns. Their household income was just shy of $21 million. In a true progressive tax system, the Romneys would never pay a lower tax rate than the Obamas. Dorothy Brown We do not have a progressive tax system. The notion of a progressive tax system is the lie that has been perpetuated far too long. First, not all income is taxed the same. While our income tax has always had progressive rates, for most of the 20th century a lower rate applied to certain nonwage income. That rate differential was increased dramatically as a result of the Bush tax cuts. Most of the Romneys' income comes from stock ownership. Stock dividends and capital gains are generally not subject to our progressive rate system. Income from stock is taxed at a flat 15% rate. Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans owns stock in a way that qualifies for the flat rate. Of that minority, very few benefit the way the Romneys do. An analysis of IRS statistics show that for households up to $200,000, no more than about 5% of their income is eligible for the flat 15% rate. Those households combined represent well more than 90% of American households. The Simpson-Bowles commission included a proposal that all income should be taxed the same. While some would say that is a radical step, it is precisely what we did in 1986. Second, not all deductions are treated the same. Two-thirds of all taxpayers do not itemize their deductions but take the standard deduction. So, as a result, most Americans do not even benefit from the myriad of special interest group deductions found in our tax code. In addition, under a progressive tax system, the value of a deduction depends upon what rate your last dollar is taxed. That is referred to as your marginal tax rate. The more income you have, the higher your marginal tax rate and the greater the value of the deduction. For example, if your marginal tax rate is 35%, then for every dollar you spend, you save 35 cents. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, then for every dollar you spend, you save only 15 cents. That explains why those in higher income brackets seek out tax deductions as a way to save money on their taxes. Third, all of this is supposed to be a secret. The only reason we have the information is because taxpayers voluntarily disclosed it -- either because they are presidential candidates or concerned citizens such as investor Warren Buffett. The IRS statistics do a great job of masking this information because the real problem lies within the top 1% of taxpayers, and the data are not presented in a way that isolates that group. Congress decides to enact a tax law, and the president signs the bill. While presidents voluntarily release their tax returns, members of Congress do not. The first step toward real tax reform would be for every member of Congress to release his or her tax return. We can see which tax provisions benefit them, and we can compare their effective tax rates with our own. Achieving meaningful tax reform will require very few steps. First, tax all forms of income at the same rate. Second, repeal the progressive tax system and enact a flat tax. If a flat tax is good enough for Mitt and Ann Romney, it should be good enough for the rest of us. Most flat tax proponents, however, want a flat tax, but they want to exempt income from stock completely. That would mean Mitt and Ann Romney's already low 15% effective tax rate would be cut even further. That would be wrong-headed tax reform. Finally, most deductions should be eliminated. Most taxpayers do not itemize, so this change would only affect about one-third of taxpayers -- and their accountants and tax lawyers. Whenever Congress enacts a deduction, it creates winners and losers. That must stop. To be sure, every special interest group will oppose even the hint of this suggestion. But we outnumber them. I don't think it's fair that the richest Americans pay taxes at a lower rate than most taxpayers and neither should you. Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion</text>

<text>'Buffett Rule' is just playing to the crowd By Ruben Navarrette Jr., CNN Contributor updated 8:19 AM EDT, Thu September 22, 2011 Warren Buffett wrote in an op-ed: "My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress." STORY HIGHLIGHTS Ruben Navarrette: Gallup Poll finds majority favor raising taxes on corporations and the rich "Buffett Rule" would set minimum tax rate for people earning more than $1 million a year Navarrette says this is an election gimmick because Obama knows it won't pass Navarrette: In a fair system, everyone would pay the same percentage of income in taxes Editor's note: Ruben Navarrette Jr. writes a weekly column for CNN.com and is a nationally syndicated columnist. San Diego, California CNN -- Billionaire Warren Buffett has been thinking about the inequities in the U.S. tax system at least since June 2007. I know this because, during PBS' Democratic presidential debate in which I served on a panel of journalists, I asked the eight Democrats, including Barack Obama, what they thought of comments Buffett had made about the unfairness of a tax system where his secretary paid a higher percentage of her income in taxes than he did. I asked Obama if he agreed with Buffett that the rich weren't paying their fair share, and what he would do about it. "There's no doubt that the tax system has been skewed, " Obama answered . "But I think this goes to a broader question, and that is, are we willing to make the investments in genuine equal opportunity in this country "People aren't looking for charity, and one of the distressing things sometimes when we have a conversation about race in America is that we talk about welfare and we talk about poverty, but what people really want is fairness," he said. "They want people paying their fair share of taxes." Ruben Navarrette Jr. I'll co-sign the last part. People should pay their fair share, and that clearly isn't happening. It's true that, at the macro level, the wealthiest people collectively pay most of the taxes in this country. But it's also true that, at the micro level, individual taxpayers in the upper income brackets often take advantage of tax laws that allow them to pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than everyday Americans. This doesn't make the wealthy bad people. But it does make for a bad system. It's no wonder that public opinion polls consistently show that Americans want the rich to pay more. This week, a Gallup Poll found that 70% of respondents favor raising taxes on some corporations by eliminating certain tax deductions and 66% favor increasing income taxes on individuals earning at least $200,000 a year and families earning at least $250,000. Now, under what it is being called the Buffett Rule, the White House wants to give people what they want. Framing it as an attempt at deficit reduction, the administration is proposing a new minimum rate for people earning more than $1 million a year, all to help make sure they pay at least the same percentage of their income as middle-class Americans. Explain it to me: The "Buffett Rule" Clinton: Wealthy should do their part Do rich pay less than middle class Predictably, conservatives reacted with howls of protest and accused Obama of engaging in class warfare. Obama responded, "This is not class warfare. It's math." Actually, it's neither. It's election year gimmickry that stands no chance of going anywhere with a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. Obama knows that, and that's why he considers it safe to propose such a plan now rather than in the first half of his administration when the House was in the hands of Democrats. Why didn't he propose it then I think it's because it might actually have become law, and then the Democrats would have owned this new tax policy and have had to answer to voters in future elections. This way, Obama gets to excite the base in time for his re-election campaign with a proposal that won't go anywhere, without having to pay a political price. As for the Buffett Rule itself, it isn't a bad idea. But it isn't a particularly good one either. The current system, the one Buffett complains about, is inequitable. But the Obama plan would just flip the inequity so the wealthy pay more. We would go from overburdening the middle class to putting the burden on the rich. That would preserve the progressive tax rates, but it wouldn't be progress. The answer lies in a third way: a fairer, flatter tax that lets all Americans pay the same percentage of their income in taxes. Maybe it would be 15%. Or 17%. Or 20%. The specifics aren't as important as the concept. About 15 or 20 years ago, you could hear support for that idea from conservative Republicans like the late Jack Kemp, the former congressman and 1996 GOP vice presidential nominee, and billionaire Steve Forbes, who ran for president in 1996 and 2000. Fiscal conservatives liked a flat tax because they thought it was wrong to punish overachievers who earn a lot of money with confiscatory tax rates, and they saw it as a way of making the tax system more equitable. Conservatives were right back then. Yet, they're wrong now to defend the current system. The White House doesn't have the right solution. But there is no point in denying the problem. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.</text>

<title>A Republican tries to save the minimum wage increase - CNN.com</title>
<text>A Republican tries to save the minimum wage increase By Lisa Desjardins, CNN Capitol Hill Reporter updated 10:50 AM EDT, Sat April 5, 2014 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Republican Sen. Susan Collins is looking to see if a deal is possible Maine senator has a history of trying to find deals on big, divisive issues Democrats want to raise the minimum wage nearly $3, to $10.10 an hour While it would cause some job cuts, the proposal would boost others from poverty Washington CNN -- Again stepping into the role of compromise-seeker, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is launching what may be a long-shot effort to forge bipartisan compromise over a minimum wage increase. "I'm reaching out to members on both sides of the aisle about whether or not it's possible," the Republican told a handful of reporters Tuesday. "I don't know whether it is." Collins laid out a possible framework she is floating in initial conversations: • Wages: Increase the minimum wage to something higher than the current $7.25 an hour, but lower than the $10.10 that Democrats want. • Hours: To bring in more Republicans, raise the number of hours that define "full-time" employees under Obamacare. Currently individuals working 30 hours or more are "full-time" under the law. • Small business: Add an extension of small business tax credits. Ryan budget aims to cut $5.1 trillion, balance in 10 years Inside Politics: Ryan's utopia This is the latest example of Collins' work toward finding space for a deal on large, divisive issues. She made one of the earliest proposals to avoid the government shutdown, spent weeks trying to find agreement on an unemployment benefits extension, and has regularly been a key vote allowing issues to come to the Senate floor. For Collins, $7.25 is too low. But, $10.10 an hour is just too high. "I've talked to employers in Maine who have said they would have to curb hiring and actually have to lay people off with that kind of increase," she said, "but they are open to a more modest increase, they could accommodate that." But as Collins tries to find a middle ground, both sides of the debate continue digging in around polar positions. Obama takes minimum wage pitch to Michigan "If a bill includes raising the minimum wage, then it's a bad idea to put people out of work," said Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. He and many other Republicans cite a Congressional Budget Office report which concluded that a minimum wage increase would cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs. Toomey was well known for his attempt at compromise over background checks on guns last year, but he insists he is not budging on the minimum wage. "If you increase it on a smaller scale, that I suppose makes it less bad, but it's still bad," he said. As Republicans exclaim "jobs," those on the left shout "poverty." "That minimum wage pay of $7.25 an hour is really a starvation wage," said Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent. He and many Democrats point out that the same CBO report concluded that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty, but a lower increase would have just one-third the effect. He insists he won't settle for a penny less than $10.10. "No, I strongly believe we need to have a $10.10 minimum wage." Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada took a similar stance in February. And what's more, Democrats have been unyielding toward many potential changes to Obamacare, including proposals to redefine "full-time" employees. That leaves Collins in the middle. Standing by herself outside the Senate doors, she smiled and stuck to her goal statement. "I'm trying to see if a potential compromise could garner sufficient support," she told reporters. Reid has said a minimum wage vote could come up in the Senate as soon as next week. Asked for her timeline, Collins shrugged, "Well, it's coming up pretty fast."</text>

<title>Minimum-wage workers live on the edge - CNN.com</title>
<text>Learn what the minimum wage is in your state » "They're often low-skill, low-education, low-experience," said Paul Menchik, director of graduate programs in economics at Michigan State University. "Things have changed a bit. People used to say, 'Well, they're teenagers.' But there are adults who are making low or close to minimum wage." Don't Miss iReport.com: Are you surviving on minimum wage Minimum-wage earners tend to be unmarried part-time workers in service-industry jobs who are younger than 25 years old and have not completed high school. Race and ethnicity seem to make little difference. Three percent of female workers and 1 percent of male workers are paid at or below the minimum, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Davis said he hoped to learn welding or another trade and perhaps go to college. "I don't want to be 25 and still be making minimum wage," he said. He said he moved out of his sister's home, where he paid $400 a month, because he wanted to have a place of his own. "There are quite a few minimum wage recipients who are, say, teenagers or part of a larger household, but if you're on your own, it's very difficult," Menchik said. "In fact, you would be under the federal poverty line, even if you worked 2,000 hours [per year], if there are two people in the household." About 60 percent of minimum-wage employees work in the leisure and hospitality industry, primarily food and drink establishments. However, many of these employees receive tips as a significant portion of their income. The industries with the largest proportion of low-wage jobs where tips don't play a significant role are education and health services 8.3 percent and retail trade 8.2 percent. "People who are close to the minimum wage will probably see a raise as well," Menchik said. "There is some echo effect on people right above it." Federal programs such as food stamps and Medicaid are available to low-income Americans, and the earned income tax credit specifically targets low-wage workers, Menchik said. "You may be able to survive" with food stamps, Menchik said. "Maybe not very well, but ..." iReport.com: Are you surviving on minimum wage Even after a 70-cent raise, low-wage workers will just barely get by, he said. "They'll just get by a little bit better." Families in poverty find ways to cut corners, watering down milk and filling up on "cheap and filling carbohydrates instead of protein," which can lead to health problems, Menchik said. Davis said he's been feeling better about his move in recent weeks, thanks to his friends' generosity. They've provided him with a television and furniture, things he now doesn't have to worry about buying. He doesn't buy gasoline, choosing instead to rely on Atlanta's mass transit system. Because he was making more than the minimum wage before it rose Thursday, he expects that his new wage still will be above the new mark. He's not sure how much the increase will help him. "I want to see a difference on my check before I can say it's better," he said. He noted that prices for food and other things are rising, and he said he wished the minimum wage would rise more often. Before the minimum wage rose to $5.85 last year, it was left unchanged at $5.15 since 1997. "Why doesn't it go up every year" Davis asked.</text>

<title>Why the U.S. has a culture of dependency - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why the U.S. has a culture of dependency By Matthew Spalding, Special to CNN updated 5:44 PM EDT, Fri September 21, 2012 A young man waits to apply for food stamps at the Cooperative Feeding Program in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in February 2011. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Matthew Spalding: U.S. social welfare programs are creating a vast culture of dependency He says the welfare state removes the stigma from taking government support He says longtime recipients lose work habits and jobs skills Spalding: The U.S. must require work for assistance and better target poverty programs Editor's note: Matthew Spalding is vice president of American Studies and director of the B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C. CNN -- For most of American history, the average farmer, shop owner or entrepreneur could live an entire life without getting anything from the federal government except mail service. But those days have gone the way of the Pony Express. Last year, the Wall Street Journal reported that 49% of the population lives in a household where at least one person gets some type of government benefit. The Heritage Foundation's annual Index of Dependence on Government tracks government spending and creates a weighted score adjusted for inflation of federal programs that contribute to dependency. It reports that in 2010, 67.3 million Americans received either Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Social Security, support for higher education or other assistance once considered to be the responsibility of individuals, families, neighborhoods, churches, and other civil society institutions -- an 8% increase from the year before. Matthew Spalding These people aren't necessarily dependent on government; many could live even live well without their Social Security check, Pell grant or crop subsidy. That's not the point. The problem is that Washington is building a culture of dependency, with ever-more people relying on an ever-growing federal government to give them cash or benefits. This is a growing and dangerous trend. The United States thrives because of a culture of opportunity that encourages work and disdains relying on handouts. The growth of the welfare state, a confusing alphabet soup of programs that are supposed to help low-income Americans make ends meet and do not include entitlements such as Social Security or Medicare, is turning us into a land where many expect, and see no stigma attached to, drawing regular financial support from the federal government. What did Romney mean by 'those people' Who Romney's 47% really are Romney defends his '47%' comment Woodward: Romney is dissing the base Consider means-tested social welfare programs. The federal government operates at least 69 programs that provide assistance deliberately and exclusively to poor and lower-income people. The benefits include cash, food, housing, medical care and social services. Yet when poverty expert Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examined these anti-poverty programs, he found that only two, the earned income tax credit and the additional child refundable credit, require recipients to actually work for their benefits. It had been three, but earlier this year, the Obama administration effectively set aside the most well-known welfare work requirements, those specifically written into the 1996 Temporary Assistance to Needy Families law. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that states could apply for a waiver of the law's clearly stated work requirements. CNNMoney: The poor do have jobs Under a culture of dependency, poverty becomes a trap, and recipients get stuck. Long-term welfare recipients lose work habits and job skills and miss out on the marketplace contacts that lead to job opportunities. That's a key reason the government should require welfare recipients to work as much as they can. What could be called "workfare" thus tends to increase long-term earnings among potential recipients. Another problem is that we simply can't afford all this spending. The national debt is at $16 trillion, more than the entire GDP of the United States last year. High as it is, that debt is about to soar. More than 78 million baby boomers are retiring onto Social Security and Medicare in the next 15 years or so. Under Obamacare, Medicaid is set to explode as well. Within just one generation, total federal spending could reach nearly 36% of GDP, and the Congressional Budget Office says debt held by the public could reach nearly 200% of GDP. That will crowd out virtually all other government spending, including national defense. Future Congresses could impose deep cuts in social welfare programs across the board or raise massive taxes to support these exploding programs. The results would be chaotic and unpredictable. News: Romney remarks: Plain truth or huge mistake It doesn't have to be this way. We can reduce dependency on government and focus benefits on those who are truly needy. For example, by including work requirements and promoting marriage being raised in a married family significantly reduces a child's chances of being in poverty, we'll help rekindle the American Dream for everyone. All poverty programs should be reviewed to make certain they're helping people instead of harming them. Social welfare programs should help people up, not hold them down.</text>

<sentence cont= 1>The growth of the welfare state, a confusing alphabet soup of programs that are supposed to help low-income Americans make ends meet and do not include entitlements such as Social Security or Medicare, is turning us into a land where many expect, and see no stigma attached to, drawing regular financial support from the federal government.</sentence>

<title>Why China needs to spend more on welfare - CNN.com</title>
<text>Why China needs to spend more on welfare By Li Gan, Special to CNN updated 12:13 AM EST, Tue March 5, 2013 A file image of 90-year-old Li Xiuying collecting bottles and cardboard boxes to sell for recycling in Beijing, 2010. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gan: China's plans to boost social welfare spending don't go far enough Key challenge for China's leaders is moving to a consumption-driven economy Measures to encourage Chinese consumption have had limited success Research shows top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income Editor's note: Li Gan is Professor of Economics at Texas A&M University and the Director of the China Household Finance Survey at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in China. He obtained his PhD in economics from University of California at Berkeley in 1998. He is a specialist in empirical microeconomics using household level data. CNN -- The challenge facing the next generation of the Chinese leadership is steering the nation as it moves from an export and investment driven economy to a more sustainable consumption-driven economy. However, such transformation will not be easy. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. The expansion of higher education since mid-1990s was one early attempt. While a success in matriculation -- 19% of Chinese under the age of 30 have a college degrees -- the move failed to spur consumption as families instead saved to afford university educations. A similar story can be seen in the commercialization of the housing market. Families have to save increasingly more in order to afford apartments with rising prices. Given the spotty success of Beijing policy to boost consumption, new research suggests the key may lie in tackling China's growing divide between the rich and the poor. READ: Why China needs to learn the three R's The government has never publicly released household-level data necessary to study this problem. To gauge the scope of the problem, my colleagues and I at China Household Finance Survey conducted a nationwide survey, interviewing a random sample of 8,438 households in China, both rural and urban. We found that China's Gini coefficient -- a number that is widely used to measure a country's income inequality -- is 0.61. This number suggests a level of income inequality so high that can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. In the U.S., this number is 0.39. Income inequality is the key reason for China's low consumption rate. The rich hold the vast majority of Chinese savings. The top 10% of households have 69% of the total savings, and average saving rate for these households is a staggering 60%. Conversely, about half of the Chinese households surveyed have negligible savings. Therein lies the dilemma for Beijing's new leaders as they try to make Chinese consumers, not exports, the key driver of China's economy. Why The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. The low savings rate of most Chinese households surveyed suggest they simply don't have the money to spend. To move toward a consumer-based economy, therefore, raising the income -- and spending -- levels for the poor is key. The data suggests China's rich are already spending what they need, and pocketing most of the rest. Li Gan Here the next generation of Chinese leadership can and should play a significant role. An effective approach to reduce the inequality and to boost consumption, however, is to shift government spending priorities away from massive infrastructure development -- roads, railroads and airports -- and toward social welfare investment and income transfer programs. Studies have shown that spending on social welfare can have a substantial effect on consumption. In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. Although 90% of Chinese population is currently covered by three basic health insurance systems, benefits differ substantially across the three systems because of different levels of contributions made by the government to the insurance premiums. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance. Another important area that government can do is to establish an effective unemployment insurance system. China's urban unemployment rate was at 8.0% in the summer of 2012. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. It also pays too little: unemployment benefit is only 17% of the average salary compared to 47% in the U.S. and 60% in Germany. Author: Groundhog Day for China's Xi China's migrants struggle Chinese students look elsewhere to live Given the challenges ahead, China's new leadership should view this with some urgency: When the economy is in transition, unemployment rate will likely rise and more people will need help. China can also learn from successful programs in the developed and developing countries. Programs such as Earned Income Tax Credits of the United States help the poor who actually work. Many developing countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and India have various Conditional Cash Transfer programs that pay poor families if they keep their kids in the school. Recognizing the serious income inequality problem in China, Beijing issued a new income redistribution policy in February. The new policy moves in the right direction, but is not nearly enough. Beijing plans to raise the government spending on social welfare programs by two percentage points within next five years, from 12% to 14%. The comparable number in the United States is 37%. If Chinese government wants to serious tackle the income inequality while helping boost consumption of the country, they have to work on a much larger scale. There is money on the table to support this. China's state owned enterprises SOEs are tremendously profitable due to their monopoly positions but only turn in less than 10% of those profits to the government. Beijing runs a budget deficit of only 1% of its GDP. According to the new plan, Beijing will demand five percentage points more of the share of the profits from SOEs. That's not enough. If Beijing doubles its budget deficit still very low relative to most developed countries and boosts revenue from SOEs on social welfare programs and income transfers, China would spend at similar percentage as the U.S. and inequality may be reduced to a similar rate. If the government creates a stronger social safety net for its citizens, Chinese workers will feel less pressure to save for health emergencies, unemployment and retirement, and more likely to buy goods and services -- and create a mature consumer-driven economy.
